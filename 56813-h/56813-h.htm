<h3>A Little Surprise</h3>

<p>Anita Gibbons has been waiting outside
at the station on the bench nearest
the field since twenty minutes of
six, and it was now nearly seven as she rose
to go. The bright pleasure with which she
had started out was fled: he had not come.
The sun, wind, and reform of the spring
afternoon, in combination with a becoming
new suit and hat, had produced their annual
effect of inspiring her to surprise her husband
by meeting him on his return from town, that
they might walk home bridally together in
the sweet evening daylight. She had been
hitherto undeterred by remembrance of the
historic fact that Mr. Gibbons was never
known to come on time when thus pleasurably
expected; but memory was beginning to
chill her now, as well as the wind on her back.
She had done all this before!</p>

<p>Yet what business unknown this morning;
could have kept him? It was neither the first
nor the last of the month, always mysterious
days of threatened detention. He had not
passed her by unnoticed, for she had risen as
each train came in to scan the men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
dropped on to the platform and hurried off,
some of them looking back to raise their hats
to the pretty woman on the platform.</p>

<p>She hurried now as she walked across the
field, feeling guiltily amid her disappointment
that dinner would be waiting, and that she
had left no word of her whereabouts with the
maid, having in fact slipped out of the house
unseen, to escape the clamouring notice of
her only child, who was near his early bed-time.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Mrs. Gibbons. Coming
back from town so late?”</p>

<p>She looked up to see a friend approaching
on the foot-path.</p>

<p>“Oh, good-evening, Mr. Ferris! No, I’ve
only come from the station; I’ve been looking
for my husband.”</p>

<p>He stopped half-way past her.</p>

<p>“Why, he came out in the five-fifteen with
me! He slipped off when it slowed up, and
jumped down the embankment; he said he
was in a hurry to get home. Too bad if
you’ve missed him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” said Mrs. Gibbons, hastily,
breaking almost into a run. Arnold, she
knew, hated to find her out of the house.</p>

<p>As she went up the steps now, the door
opened before she reached it, and an excited
voice exclaimed: “Ah, ma’am, it’s yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
at last! It’s the neighbourhood we do be
having searched for you!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Katy?” Mrs. Gibbons,
who had stood arrested on the threshold,
pushed her way in. “Where is Mr. Gibbons?”</p>

<p>“He’s gone.”</p>

<p>“<em>Gone!</em>”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, gone back to the city. ’Twas
like this: he bid me say that he had to be
meeting friends—I disremember the name—on
the other side, at the ferry, or he could
have telephoned ’em, ma’am. ’Twas a grand
dinner they had planned for to-night, unexpected
like.”</p>

<p>“Was the name”—Mrs. Gibbons paused
that she might have courage to grasp her loss—“Was
the name Atterbury?”</p>

<p>“It was, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Her beloved Atterburys! They were to
sail for Rio at the end of the week. This was
a dinner and a theatre party planned before
and postponed. They <em>could</em> not have it without
her.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gibbons must have known I’d be
home in a minute!”</p>

<p>“Sure, he waited for you, ma’am, till he
had to run to the station below to catch the
express; but he bid me tell you to be sure
and take the seven o’clock train in, and he’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
keep the party waiting at the ferry for
you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibbons glanced at the clock. It was
after seven now! But there was a seven-twenty-five
train which reached town almost
as soon, and Arnold would surely wait for
that, even if the others had gone on to Martin’s,
where they would dine. The Atterburys
always went to Martin’s. She was accustomed
to try and bend fate to her uses
with an uncalculating ardour that focussed itself
entirely on the impulse of the moment.
To the suburbanite a little dinner in town is
the height of pleasure, the one perfect feast!
And with the Atterburys! She really could
not miss it.</p>

<p>“I don’t care for anything to eat. Don’t
let the fire out,” she dictated rapidly. “See
that Harold doesn’t get uncovered, and <em>don’t</em>
bolt the front door. We’ll be home before
twelve, but you needn’t sit up for us. Just
lie on the lounge in the nursery.” She did not
remind forgetful Katy to put the milk tickets
in the pail set outside the back door, and only
remembered it as she was half-way to the
station.</p>

<p>The train was due in town at eight-five,
but it was late here, and the extra ten minutes
seemed a thousand “prickly seconds.” The
spring twilight was coming to a close, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
when she stepped into the car in which the
lamps gleamed dully over the plush seats, it
was like stepping into the long tunnel of the
night. Only a few men from further up the
road sprawled and dozed wearily on their
way. She was unaccustomed to going out
thus alone, and for an instant a panic-struck
thought of failure seized her, but she lost it
in the action of her hurrying brain, which
constantly pictured the delightful meeting
with her expectant husband and the waiting
party. By the inalienable law of travel, which
ordains that delay in one mode of locomotion
means delay in every other, the ferry-boat
could not “hit her slip,” but wobbled up and
down crosswise in the current, bumping
against the piles at either end, with much
ringing of the pilot’s bell, and losing of minutes—and
minutes—and minutes. But at
last Mrs. Gibbons made her way into the
big, lighted waiting-room, the haven of her
hopes. It took no more than one glance to reveal
that there was neither group nor husband
waiting for her. The place was entirely
empty, save for a few Italian emigrants, and
the clock pointed to twenty minutes of nine.</p>

<p>So vividly had Mrs. Gibbons pictured her
own state of mind as that of her husband—a
habit of which fell experience could not break
her—that even in the shock of not finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
him she felt instantly that some provision had
been made for this contingency. She could
go straight over and join the party at Martin’s,
but he might have left some word for
her. The man at the news stand might know.
She hovered uncertainly around the pictorial
exhibit, trying to screw up a suddenly-waning
courage, and then found voice to say engagingly:</p>

<p>“I’m looking for my husband.”</p>

<p>“What did you say, lady?” The man
stopped in his work of sorting papers.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for my husband. He’s been
waiting for me here for a long time—with a
party—but he’s gone now. I thought perhaps
he had left some message here with
you.”</p>

<p>“What kind of looking man was he?”
asked the news clerk. He leaned forward
companionably.</p>

<p>“He—he’s tall, and clean shaven, with a
light overcoat, and blue eyes—and——”
She groped around for some distinguishing
characteristic to elicit a gleam of response—“a
square chin—with a dimple in it.” She
felt her own fatuousness. “You—you’d know
him if you saw him.”</p>

<p>The clerk turned to a boy who had appeared
behind the counter.</p>

<p>“Did you see a man with a light overcoat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and”—a spasm passed over his face—“and
a dimple in his chin? Did he leave any
message here?” Mrs. Gibbons felt hotly that
he was laughing at her, although he looked
impassive.</p>

<p>“Naw,” said the boy, “he didn’t leave no
message with me.” He added on reflection,
“I ain’t seen no one hanging ’round but a
chunky feller with a black <em>mus</em>tache.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t seen any one but a stout man
with a black mustache,” reported the clerk
officially, while two pairs of eyes stared at her
in a disconcerting manner.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Mrs. Gibbons; is there
anything we can do for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Worthington—and Mr. Worthington!”
Mrs. Gibbons looked as one who
sees a familiar face in the desert. “You
don’t <em>know</em> how glad I am to meet you!
I’m looking for my husband.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Mrs. Worthington, with a
faint chill of surprise. She was a slight
woman, elegantly gowned, with a thin expressionless
face. Her husband was like
unto her, with the overcoat of opulence.
They were new neighbours of Mrs. Gibbons,
who kept themselves politely aloof from
suburban social life, spending most of their
time in town, where they seemed to have
a large connection. They were perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
last persons to whom Mrs. Gibbons would
have turned in a dilemma, but she found
comfort in their curious attention as she
explained the situation, to conclude by
saying:</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ll go right over now to
Martin’s. If they waited for me here until
after eight, they would be hardly more than
started at dinner. All I want to know is
what car I ought to take.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Worthington’s eyelids flickered a
response to her husband.</p>

<p>“Pray allow us to escort you there,” said
Mr. Worthington. “It is really quite on our
way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re <em>very</em> kind,” said Mrs. Gibbons,
following her leaders gratefully, after
a moment or two of demur. She had naturally
the feeling that when a man took the
thing in hand it would be all right.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was so dark at night
when you were out alone by yourself, until I
came off the ferry-boat,” she confided.</p>

<p>Mrs. Worthington’s eyelids flickered assent.
She sat in the trolley car in a sort of
isolated though subdued richness of attire,
her heavy silken skirts folded over decorously
to escape contaminating touch, her embossed
cloak and large boa held elegantly in
place with her white-gloved hand. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
seemed to demand a coach and four. The
light spring suit which Mrs. Gibbons had
thought so fetching in the afternoon looked
cheap and thin in comparison. She did not
know of the blue intenseness of her eyes and
the rich flush on her young cheek which
made each man who entered the car turn to
look at her.</p>

<p>When Mr. Worthington bent over from
the suspending strap to ask, “You are quite
sure your husband is at Martin’s?” she answered
with her bright, upward glance, “Oh,
yes, quite sure!” He would be at a little
round table, with John and Agnes Atterbury,
in the red-carpeted room, looking out for
her, and how glad they would be to see her!</p>

<p>She dashed up the steps ahead of the
Worthingtons, and a waiter came deferentially
forward. Why should her heart suddenly
fail her when she stood looking in
upon the lighted scene?</p>

<p>“I’m looking for my husband,” said Mrs.
Gibbons. She dashed from one doorway to
another, peering in. “No, he isn’t here—perhaps
in the other room—I don’t see him
here either. It’s very strange, <em>very</em>!”</p>

<p>“What is it Madame desires?” The head
waiter was following her rushing movements.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for my husband”—in full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
torrent of explanation her tone had grown
louder. “He came here a little while ago.”
She paused, suddenly aware of a whisper
sibilating around.</p>

<p>“She’s looking for her husband.” Several
people stopped eating. The head waiter regarded
her suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Was Monsieur alone?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no!” said Mrs. Gibbons with
eager candour. “No, indeed! There was a
lady——”</p>

<p>“Aa—h!” said the head waiter. “Monsieur
was with another lady!” An embarrassing
murmur of interest made itself
felt. He fixed her with a placating eye, as
he added, hurriedly, “But Monsieur, as
Madame perceives, is not here. He exists
not. If the carriage of Madame”—he stopped
happily—“But behold now the friends of
Madame!”</p>

<p>The wild blaze of happiness died down
almost as suddenly as it had risen in Mrs.
Gibbons’ breast, as she turned to see the
Worthingtons advancing decorously once
more to her rescue. Her bright hopes were
buried in ashes.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know what to do,” she
breathed. “He isn’t here after all—<em>he isn’t
here</em>!”</p>

<p>“Will you not go on with us to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
opera?” asked Mrs. Worthington. “We
would be very glad to have you. We did
not care to get in for the first act.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I couldn’t do that—you’re so
very kind—but I couldn’t really. I must get
home at once. Mr. Gibbons will go home
early. I want to go home.”</p>

<p>“We will then, of course, return with you,”
said Mr. Worthington, resignedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, <em>please</em> don’t! It isn’t at all
necessary. I <em>couldn’t</em> have you do it. I
know the way now, and—please don’t!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Worthington will not allow you to
go home alone,” said his wife, with polite
weariness of the subject. “The next train
does not leave until ten o’clock. Of course,
if you really wish so much to return—although
Mr. Gibbons is not at all likely to
get back before we would—do not hesitate
out of consideration for us or <em>our</em> convenience.
But I think you would enjoy the
opera.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibbons stood unhappily irresolute.
How could she drag these people home
with her, much as she now longed to get
there? If they would <em>only</em> let her go alone!
After all, if Arnold were off having a good
time, why shouldn’t she be gay and have a
good time, too?</p>

<p>“Well, if you really want to take me—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it won’t be very late——” She was conscious
of her ungraciousness. “Oh, I’ll enjoy
it immensely!”</p>

<p>“We will leave whenever you say so,”
said Mr. Worthington, with his invariable
deference.</p>

<p>So unused was Mrs. Gibbons to going out
with any one but her husband that Mr.
Worthington’s arm felt startlingly thin and
queer and unnatural when her hand rested
on it as he helped her across the street.
Everything was unnatural. Her acceptance,
she found, necessitated his standing in
the rear of the house, while she occupied his
seat. Mrs. Worthington relinquished her
entirely to the promised enjoyment. The
music was indeed beautiful, but she still kept
hold of the ever-tightening thread of suspense
and longing; Arnold might be gay
without her, but she couldn’t be gay without
him. To think of all she was missing
choked her! Mr. Worthington came forward
between the acts to ask perfunctorily if
Mrs. Gibbons wished to leave, but his wife
showed no signs of moving.</p>

<p>It was with the first joy of the evening
that she saw the curtain descend, and felt
that she could tear at full speed for the
elevated road and her own dear ferry
and her own dear home. She must get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
there before Arnold, or he would be wild
with anxiety; her desire to meet him in
town was nothing to her desire now to
head him off at home. But she reckoned
without her host, literally. Her entertainers
had been met by friends as they passed
slowly down amid the crush in the aisle, and
after the voluble greetings she was panic-struck
by hearing one of the strangers say:</p>

<p>“You’ll come to supper with us now?
Just around the corner!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” Mrs. Worthington was almost
animated. “If we have time,” she added,
turning to her husband.</p>

<p>“Why, we can’t get the twelve o’clock, if
we stay, but we will have plenty of time for
the twelve-thirty, if Mrs. Gibbons doesn’t object,”
said Mr. Worthington.</p>

<p>“We have a friend with us,” said Mrs.
Worthington, in languid explanation. “Mrs.
Gibbons, Mrs. Freshet, Mr. Freshet.”</p>

<p>“We will, of course, be pleased to have
your friend take supper with us,” said Mrs.
Freshet.</p>

<p>How could Mrs. Gibbons object? Her
eyes pleaded, but her lips were perforce
silent; and, comfortably settled in the
restaurant, the others talked about matters
of common interest, while she sat on the
edge of her chair by the gleaming little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
table, and fumbled at her oysters with her
fork, watching the hands of the clock at the
end of the room. The Freshets were even
more ornately dressed than the Worthingtons,
with a floridity of manner that somehow
overstepped a certain delicate line.</p>

<p>Once Mrs. Freshet smiled at the guest over
her white satin and sables to ask:</p>

<p>“Is this the friend of whose beautiful home
I have heard so much?”</p>

<p>“I—I think not,” said Mrs. Gibbons, with a
stricken glimpse of the interior of her little
dwelling. “I only met the Worthingtons by
accident to-night,” she added, impulsively,
with a longing for sympathy. “I was looking
for my husband.”</p>

<p>“How singular!” said Mrs. Freshet, with
a blank stare, and turned at once to continue
a conversation on bargains with Mrs. Worthington,
while Mrs. Gibbons, trying to make
sprightly remarks in response to Mr. Freshet
and Mr. Worthington, agonizingly watched
the clock. Ten minutes of twelve—five minutes
of twelve—she could not have stood it a
second longer, when Mr. Worthington rose to
hurry them off.</p>

<p>The rushing of the elevated train could not
keep up with Mrs. Gibbons’ hastening spirit;
but somehow, inexplicably, after a while even
the rushing stopped—the train halted—went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
forward a little—and halted again, between
stations.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>what</em> is the matter?” said Mrs. Gibbons,
as Mr. Worthington returned with
several men from investigation.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing to speak of; there’s a fire
ahead somewhere, and we’re blocked for a
few minutes. Mrs. Gibbons—<em>Madam</em>! Pray
keep your seat, you can <em>not</em> get out!”</p>

<p>“They do say as there’s a family yet in
the burning house,” suggested a sympathizing
listener.</p>

<p>“Naw, they got thim out, but there’s two
firemen hurted,” said another.</p>

<p>“What is it, Amelia!” Mr. Worthington
turned his attention hastily from Mrs. Gibbons
to his wife. “Do you feel faint?”</p>

<p>“A little,” murmured Mrs. Worthington,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibbons had a sickened feeling. She
could have felt faint too, if her husband had
been along to sit down by her solicitously,
and tell her to lean on him. She would have
<em>liked</em> to feel faint. But instead, she was forced,
in common decency, to be solicitous too for
Mrs. Worthington, although she had begun
to hate her. Mr. Worthington looked nervously
at his watch until the train started
again, and when they got out to walk to the
ferry, he hurried his wife along at a pace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with which Mrs. Gibbons tried in vain to
keep up over the uneven, dirty, dimly lighted
pavements in those winding streets near the
river. Arnold never let her walk so fast
that way; she owned an ankle that had once
been sprained, and sometimes now turned
under her disastrously. But hurry as she
might, they hurried faster, under the impulse
of the new fear which made itself felt to her
without the need of words. She caught up
to the couple, and clutched them as they
stood suddenly motionless, inside the ferry-house,
facing her.</p>

<p>“What do you <em>stop</em> for? Why don’t you
go <em>on</em>?” she demanded fiercely, although she
knew too well what the dread answer must
be. The supreme stroke of suburban fate
had befallen them. They had missed the last
train out!</p>

<p>Only the initiated know what this really
means. To be cut off inexorably from home,
and the children, and the fires, and the incompetent
servants or the anxious watchers—it
is something subtly feared in every evening
journey into town, but only once in a life-time
perhaps is it experienced.</p>

<p>“We had better go to a hotel,” said Mrs.
Worthington, with agitation. “We will <em>have</em>
to go to a hotel, Foster.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can get out home some way,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
he answered, with the instinct of the man
who considers two hours in his own bed worth
ten in any other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibbons cast the reserve of decency
to the winds. They had made her miss this
train! Her husband waiting for her—the
sleeping Harold uncovered—the milk tickets
to be put in the pail to-morrow—“I don’t
care what <em>you</em> do; <em>I</em> can’t stay in town to-night.
I <em>won’t</em> stay in town, Mr. Worthington!
I’ll have to get home to-night if I
<em>swim</em> for it!”</p>

<p>“No need to do that,” said a man rapidly
coming out with a pipe-smoking group from
the ferry-house. “We’re going out on the
twelve-forty-five boat on the other road, a
couple blocks below here, and take the trolley
out. It’s Mrs. Gibbons, isn’t it? I don’t believe
you recognize me. I saw your husband
an hour or so ago at Weber and Fields.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>thank</em> you!” said Mrs. Gibbons.
“Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you!” She stumbled after the group
over the cobblestones outside of the long
wharves, still insanely warbling her gratitude,
her protectors sullenly stalking after her.
They crushed and wedged themselves into
the midst of an unsavoury and strenuous
populace on the boat that pushed out slowly
into the fog of the river, but that did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
matter—they were saved, they were off!
They were surely bound for that other side
on which lay all that made life worth living.
Then there was another mad rush for the
trolley car that went their way. Fighting,
struggling, pressing, the three snot into seats,
exhausted, and whizzed off into the dark
night. Mr. Worthington, after a few minutes,
went sound asleep, lurching as the car
lurched, his wife, poor woman, pale enough
as she sat with face averted from Mrs. Gibbons,
her lips pressed tightly together, one
hand holding mechanically to her raiment,
and the other within her husband’s arm.
Men sat with their heads on their sweet-hearts’
shoulders, in true early morning
trolley-car fashion, and every inch of standing
room was packed too thick for the eye to
penetrate with a singing, drunken, cat-calling,
indecent crowd, the last scum of a great city.
It was an offense to delicacy to be there. The
lights flared wildly up and then went out at
intervals. When they went out, Mrs. Gibbons
felt a cold terror. She had always been
afraid of drunken men, and she was so used
to the protection of love! How sorry Arnold
would be when she told him about it all, how
tender he would be of her!</p>

<p>Oh, she had never realized before how
utterly married she was, how long she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ceased to remember the independence of her
girlhood, for what a short distance her little
struts and flights were planned! So helpless,
so forlorn, so terribly outside of life was
she without him, without that individual care
which was as much a part of existence as her
own ability to raise her food to her mouth, or
move one foot before another! She thought
of a woman she knew who had lost her husband,
and who had said, “I did not know it
could be like this.” He had “given his body
to the storm” many a time and oft for her
dear sake; yet even for her a day might
sometime come—like this—when—— Her
soft cheek was cold and wet, and even through
her thought of him she was also trying to get
home and put those milk tickets in the pail
so that the child would not be bereft in the
morning. One must always remember a little
child’s needs.</p>

<p>“Ye’re frightenin’ the lady, ye big bloke.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t frightenin’ of her, ye——”</p>

<p>She shrank painfully at the notice thrust
upon her. For hours, and hours, and hours
they were jigging off over the dark salt
meadows.</p>

<p>Crash, lurch, jam—everything came to a
sudden stop. The conductor called, “All out
here for the car ahead.”</p>

<p>The sleeping ones awoke. In the scuffle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and rush forward Mrs. Gibbons became separated
from her friends. The new car was
already jammed when she reached it, with
fighting in the doorway. With one foot
raised to step up she was thrust to one side
by a man who leapt from it, followed by
several others dashing back across the tracks
and down a side street, amid cries of “Catch
him! Get the pocketbook! Catch the thief!”</p>

<p>There was a face—could it be her husband’s?
She turned wildly to peer after it
into the blankness outside of the car lights.
The next instant the bell had rung, and the
car, with the crowd on the platform all looking
one way, was vanishing swiftly down
the roadway, while Mrs. Gibbons, unnoticed,
stood alone upon the rails. She made a
futile step after it, and then stopped, appalled.
She was left behind.</p>

<p>Opposite was the long, cavernous opening
of a car-house, filled with the stalled cars.
Near her was a saloon, ending what seemed
a scattered row of small, mean houses and
shops, closed and dark. Ahead there was a
stretch of empty lots, with a faint, stationary
glimmer of light down the road. But the
saloon, though by no means brilliant, was
the lightest place. There was no sound from
within. After some hesitation, Mrs. Gibbons
wandered up on the low platform that topped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the two steps, watched by a couple of men
from the car-house. Her heart was in her
mouth as one of them came forward; but he
only glanced at her and went in the saloon,
to come out again with a wooden chair.</p>

<p>“Better set,” he remarked, laconically, and
disappeared across the street. A moment
later there were other footsteps from the
saloon, and looking up, she saw a policeman
wiping his mouth.</p>

<p>“Got left by the car?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Gibbons, raising her blue
and guileless eyes to his. “I didn’t know it
was going so soon. I was looking for my
husband.”</p>

<p>The policeman’s face changed from solicitude
to the cheerful acceptance of a familiar
situation.</p>

<p>“Give ye the slip, did he? A lady like
you, too! Sure he’s the bad lot, and not
wort’ your lookin’ for. Now don’t be frettin’
yourself, the Queen couldn’t be safer. I’m
wid you till the car comes. ’Tis an hour
away.”</p>

<p>“It’s very good of you,” said Mrs. Gibbons,
gratefully.</p>

<p>Of all the chances and changes of this
wild Walpurgis night, there could be nothing
stranger than this, that she, Nita Gibbons,
should be sitting alone amid the dark marshes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in front of a Jersey “gin-mill,” at half-past
two o’clock in the morning. It was so entirely
past all imagining that frenzy had left
her. She would probably never get home
again, but she had ceased to struggle against
fate. She sat there instead, passive, her
slight figure bent against the cold night
wind, and her hair half falling down under
her battered hat, looking dreamily at the late
twinkling stars in the black sky, and the
gloomy car-house opposite, and at the policeman
who walked up and down through the
shadows. He swayed a little unsteadily, but
he represented the guardianship of the law.
Once he came close to her and asked encouragingly,
“Would ye like a doggy?”</p>

<p>“What kind?” said Mrs. Gibbons, with a
hazy fear of too large a protective animal.</p>

<p>He pointed over his shoulder towards the
stationary light down the road. “The kind
they do be havin’ in the Owl Wagon, down
there—frankfooties or doggies, ’tis the same.
I could get ye wan, wid a roll; they’re cleaned
out in the s’loon here.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I’d rather not eat,” said Mrs.
Gibbons in haste, and then started nervously
as the noise of footsteps running broke upon
the ear. The three men who had followed
the thief came in sight from the direction in
which they had fled from the car. One called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
out, “Good-night, I’m going to hoof it
home!”</p>

<p>And another voice also called, “Glad you
got your pocketbook back again—ought to
have got the fellow, too.”</p>

<p>The third said nothing, as he came towards
the platform. Mrs. Gibbons turned her head
away. The next instant a voice of amazement
said, “<em>Nita!</em> You here!” and, looking
up, she saw her husband.</p>

<p>“Oh, Arnold, Arnold!” She stopped short
in view of his face. “Oh, Arnold, I don’t
wonder you’re surprised to see me, dear, but
I’ve been looking for you!”</p>

<p>“Looking for <em>me</em>! Nita! <em>Nita!</em> <span class="smcap">Nita!</span>”</p>

<p>The astonishment in his voice held something
ominous in it. She clung to his arm
with both hands, as she rose with him, and
hardly realized, in her excited explaining and
explaining, that she was being borne off down
the road without waiting for the car, at a
tremendous pace, and still spasmodically explaining
to a portentous silence. When he
spoke at last it was in a tone that sounded
dangerous:</p>

<p>“So the Worthingtons went off and <em>left</em>
you?”</p>

<p>“No, no, they were <em>in</em> the car, they——”</p>

<p>“I’ll—I’ll <em>see</em> Worthington to-morrow!”
He paused for control, and Mrs. Gibbons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
had a swift vision of Mr. Worthington’s
head rolling off into a basket. “I never
heard such a lot of crazy stuff—I never <em>heard</em>
of such a thing—I <em>never</em> heard of such a
thing! It all comes of your being out of the
house when I came home. What on earth
you want to go wild-goose chasing for at the
very time you know I’m coming home——”</p>

<p>“But, Arnold, I <em>didn’t</em> go wild-goose chasing.
I went to the station to surprise you.”</p>

<p>His anger grew.</p>

<p>“To surprise me! Then let me know next
time you want to surprise me. I’ve had
enough surprise to last me all the rest of my
life.”</p>

<p>He broke off with a shudder as if the
thought were too much for him.</p>

<p>“Well, you just missed it, not being with
us to-night. You’ll never have such another
chance, never. The Atterburys won’t be
back for five years.”</p>

<p>“And did you enjoy it without <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>“Enjoy it! Of course I enjoyed it. I’d
have been a fool not to. I had a glorious
time, the best dinner I ever ate, and Atterbury?—What
on earth you wanted to spoil it
all for I can’t see. <em>Take</em> care!”—his arm
went around her closely. “You’ll turn your
ankle.” His touch was ineffably gentle and
sure, in spite of the masterful rage of his tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Arnold, I’ve been so unhappy all the
evening. I——”</p>

<p>He went on, remorseless. “I’m glad you
were. I hope you <em>were</em> unhappy. It will
teach you never to do such a thing again.
When you didn’t meet us at the ferry, I was
confounded. I couldn’t think <em>what</em> had happened
to you. If everything hadn’t been ordered
ahead, tickets and all, I’d have come
straight home, but I couldn’t leave the Atterburys
in the lurch when <em>you</em> had, though I
hated to go without you. It just spoiled the
whole thing. I’ve been worrying ever since
that infernal hold-up in the elevated, thinking
of you at home alone, and then I find you
gallivanting around at the junction at three
o’clock in the morning, after coming out in
that outrageous car. If I’d known you were
there——! Well, you were just crazy to do
such a thing”—he set his teeth—“it makes
me <em>wild</em> to think of it. You don’t know <em>what</em>
might have happened. I’ll be afraid to go
off and leave you home alone. I don’t know
what you’ll do. You ought to be looked
after like a child. You oughtn’t to be left a
<em>minute</em>. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>He slowed up the pace that was rapidly
nearing them to home. His storming voice
deepened reluctantly into a distressful tenderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter? You mustn’t cry in
the street, Nita! You mustn’t, dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve had such a horrid, horrid, horrid
time!” The tears were blinding her so that
she leaned unseeing on the enfolding arm
that guided her. “I don’t mind your scolding
me. I’m not crying for <em>that</em>. I don’t mind
anything you say. I don’t mind even your
not having kissed me. Nothing makes any
difference to me as long as it’s you. I’m
crying because I’m so glad it’s you, and I can
hear your voice again. When I was trying
to find you it seemed as if it would never
end; it seemed—it seemed——” She raised
her wet eyes to his.</p>

<p>He took a swift look up and down the
empty, lifeless street, laid out straight and stiff
in the cold, faint glimmer of the dawn, and
then his lips sought hers in deep, deep acknowledgment
of the joy, and of the sorrow, to
which all love is born—one of those moments
stolen in its beautifulness from the life to come.</p>

<p>But his voice was tense again, as he set her
down within her own doorway, and he looked
at her with stern eyes of jealous care, from
which she hid the woman’s smile of love at
dear love’s unreason.</p>

<p>“You’re nearly <em>dead</em>! Don’t you stir out
of this house to-morrow until I come home—do
you hear? <em>Never</em> surprise me again!”</p>

<h3>At the Sign of the Rubber Plant</h3>

<p>“I wonder <em>what</em> he meant!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thatcher had risen from the
breakfast table from which her husband
had departed some time since, after throwing
out a mysterious hint about some event in
store for her. She had better look out for—what?
He had gone before she could question
him further.</p>

<p>She went to the front window now, gazing
down the street after Bobby, her only child,
on his way to the kindergarten. She was a
very tall young woman, yet lost none of her
femininity by her height; it seemed rather to
emphasize it in a willowy droop that always
suggested an appealing dependence, in connection
with the upward glance of her dark
eyes. Her hair was dark, like her eyes, and
very thick; her lips were red and curved;
her cheeks were usually pale, but there was a
faint glow on them now. Nevin had made a
terse but complimentary remark about her
appearance in that blue cambric morning
dress, which she had received with as much
innocent surprise as if she had not planned
for it. He had also said that he pitied that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
poor fellow next door whose wife was homely
enough to take away his appetite.</p>

<p>Mr. Thatcher’s attitude towards his wife
was the subject both of good-natured comment
and raillery among her neighbours.
His least action towards her was charged,
though unobtrusively, with that subtle and
intimate attention which one only expects
from a lover. He even had a way of helping
her up and down the steps that was “different”
to the married eye. Patently unintellectual
as Mildred Thatcher was, she yet indisputably
retained her charm for the man
who <em>was</em> intellectual. She had, in fact, that
sweet will to be beloved which instinctively
foreruns occasion, and makes a place for it in
all the little daily matters of life.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he meant! I feel exactly
as if somebody would come out from town
to-day—it’s such a lovely morning.” She
spoke half aloud as she looked down the
street through the green feathery foliage of
the elms, just out in their spring dress. The
sun shone caressingly through them upon
the crocuses peeping out in the front grass-plot,
and the air, delicately cool, was charged
with perfume. There were all the usual adjuncts
of spring in the suburbs. A department
store wagon was already delivering
parcels at a house further down, and several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
women, fresh and neatly gloved, were alertly
stepping trainward to get an early start for
the day’s shopping, impelled thither by that
soft breeze which woos womankind to the
pursuit of clothes. All down the block the
palms and rubber plants were being sunned
on piazza steps, the former, for the most part,
conspicuously brown and withered, but the
latter still chunkily green after a winter of
furnace heat and dust and gas.</p>

<p>To feel the spring air and not want to
spend money was impossible even to Mildred
Thatcher, but even if she could have purchased
the rug so badly needed for the little
drawing-room she would not leave home to-day.
She was sure some one would be out
from town. She turned now to the maid and
gave her orders for luncheon.</p>

<p>“You can make the cold meat into croquettes,
Kitty, and we’ll have pop-overs.
And I’d like you to wash out the violet centerpiece.”</p>

<p>“Very well, ma’am.”</p>

<p>The hint of a pending pleasure had set its
seal on the day. It might be Madge Stanfield
who would come, or the Laviers, or her Cousin
Lou. She set things to rights, and dusted
and arranged daintily, and put fresh violets
in the glass vases, and by and by, late in the
morning, when all was done, went out on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
piazza to listen for the train, while deciding
whether or no to send her dwindling palms to
the florist. She scrutinized the rubber plant
anxiously for some sign of growth. The rubber
plant was, in a way, a proof of the demoralizing
extremes of Mildred’s nature.
For a season she had railed intemperately at
rubber plants and their possessors, and then,
after moving from a flat to the suburbs, had
incontinently gone forth one morning on the
spur of the moment and bought one. It
somehow didn’t seem as if they were really
householders without that green and visible
emblem of a much-enduring domesticity.
Mrs. Thatcher cherished an idea that her rubber
plant would grow with tropical luxuriance,
but as yet it had only remained stolidly green.</p>

<p>“Good-morning!”</p>

<p>It was a neighbour, who, deflecting from
the pavement, came up, with a paper bag in
one hand, to lean familiarly against the post
at the foot of the low steps.</p>

<p>“Your plants need water,” she continued,
casting an officially critical eye upon them.</p>

<p>“They were watered this morning,” said
Mrs. Thatcher.</p>

<p>“It should be done at the same time every
day,” said the neighbour, obliviously. “Dear
me, it’s getting warm, isn’t it? <em>You</em> look
fresh and cool enough. I had to go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
village at the last moment for rolls for lunch.
I’m dreadfully tired. Spring weather does
make your feet hurt so, doesn’t it? Well—good-bye!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thatcher still stood looking down the
street—a train had come in while they were
talking. Yes, there was some one coming—a
lady in brown—it must be Madge. No, it
was only Mrs. Brereton.</p>

<p>“Back from the city already?” she called,
as the figure approached.</p>

<p>“Yes. I only went in to match a sample.
Dear me! how warm it is! This weather
makes your feet hurt dreadfully. I wanted
to stay in town and do something about furnishing
the new house, but it takes so long to
look at rugs, and I’ve a dressmaker waiting
for me at home this moment.” She stopped
an instant, leaning against the post, as the
other had done. “How dry your plants look!
they need water! Mercy! is that Meyer’s
wagon stopping before my house? Well,
good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said Mrs. Thatcher, coolly.
Not only was Meyer’s wagon standing before
Mrs. Brereton’s, but several other wagons
from department stores were stopping further
up the street, sending forth boys laden up to
the chin with fat, brown parcels and long,
narrow, brown parcels. Mrs. Thatcher turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
around to see yet another friend, who, without
her hat, had come out of the house adjoining,
and now dropped down beside her
on the steps.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it heavenly! I saw you out here
and couldn’t resist coming over for a minute.
I’ve been sewing so hard on the children’s
spring clothes, I’ve hardly had a glimpse of
you for a week.—Your plants need water,
don’t they?”</p>

<p>“No, they don’t,” said Mrs. Thatcher, with
unspeakable exasperation. She controlled
herself with an effort as she rose. “I’m sorry,
but I’ve got to go in the house. I’m rather
expecting company.”</p>

<p>“The express wagon seems to be coming
here,” said the friend detainingly.</p>

<p>“Why, so it is!” cried Mrs. Thatcher, her
irritation subsiding before this new interest.
The unexpected advent of the express wagon
always suggested pleasing and mysterious
possibilities to her, until recollection brought
to mind the usual case of mineral water, or
the box from the tailor’s with her husband’s
discarded clothing. This time, however, it
was a box of another kind, oblong and
wooden. The man who deposited it in the
little square hall evidently found it heavy.
This, then, was what Nevin had meant.</p>

<p>What could it be? Mrs. Thatcher stubbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
her finger with the screw-driver, and hit her
own nail lustily with the hammer, in her
efforts to open the box. When she finally
succeeded, and caught sight of the contents,
she pushed it from her with a sharp exclamation
of disgust.</p>

<p>Inside were two rows of large, morocco-bound
volumes. The gilt lettering on the
back showed that they were “Selections
from the Literature of All Nations, with
Lives of the Authors.”</p>

<p>“Of all things!” said Mrs. Thatcher in a
tone of deep disappointment. “What on
<em>earth</em> does he want to keep on getting these
subscription things for? And he <em>knows</em> we
need the money for the rug. He’ll never
read these—he’ll never even look at them.
I cannot understand it! He never <em>sees</em> a
book without wanting to buy it—he says he
just likes to <em>have</em> books. Well, <em>he’ll</em> have to
find a place to put these, for I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Shall I take the books out of the box,
ma’am?” asked Kitty, coming into the
hall.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” replied Mrs.
Thatcher wearily. “Yes, I suppose you’ll
have to; we can’t leave the box here.” She
looked over at the tiny drawing-room, with
its little spindle-legged mahogany tea-table,
the low well-filled bookcase, the rattan sofa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
with its bright pillows, and the small upright
piano, and then at the solid pile of information
at her feet. There were thirty volumes—for
she had counted them—thirty volumes
pressed down and running over with the
Literature of All Nations.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll have to pile them up in
the corner over there. I’m sure <em>I</em> don’t
know what to do with them.”</p>

<p>“And shall I put the lunch on now,
ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Is it time? Oh, yes; Bobby is coming
in. Yes, put it on.”</p>

<p>Croquettes and pop-overs and the violet
centerpiece for this arrival by express, indeed!
She felt unaccountably defrauded—a
sensation that lingered with her throughout
the whole afternoon, and tinged her with
melancholy, even when she responded to the
playful overtures or the needs of Bobby, who
kept continually running in from the back
yard to have his ball mended, or a string tied
to something. He struggled away from her
when she wanted to kiss him, and he smelled
indescribably of earth. He was of the sex
which grew up to have strange ways and
alien tastes—he even had them now. Mrs.
Thatcher had not wanted a boy, although
she loved this one devotedly. She longed
inexpressibly sometimes for a dear little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
gentle, clinging girl, who could be frivolously
dressed in soft, white, ruffly things, and have
her sweet hair curled.</p>

<p>Mildred Thatcher could never help a
mysteriously hurt feeling when her Nevin
spent his money for books, or indeed for anything
apart from her, of his own volition;
there were always so many things needed
perennially by “the house,” not to speak of
her own wardrobe. Her feminine mind was
incapacitated by nature from seeing anything
from a man’s point of view—it was
from the sheer force of her love alone that
she leapt the chasm between them. It was
from the heart, not the mind, that she
divined what she did of him, as the blind see
through feeling finger-tips. And even when
she could not perceive how he wanted his
own way—nay, when she had protested
against it with intensity—after she had once
proved herself in the right, she was apt to be
overtaken by a sweet, fiercely unreasoning
desire that he should have everything he
wanted, just because he wanted it, and
because he would love her better if he did,
and she would grovel, and cringe, and eat
her words unblushingly, in her efforts to
drive him back into his own path. If she
used all her energy now to making him send
that wealth of literature back where it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
from, she would probably labour still harder
the next day to make him get it again.</p>

<p>There was an aloofness in her greeting,
when he came home a little earlier than
usual, which he was unusually quick to detect.
His eyes were agreeably expectant,
with none of the deprecation in them which
she had looked for. Mr. Thatcher himself
was one of Mildred’s inconsistencies. She
had sworn that she would never marry any
but a very tall man, yet her Nevin, stalwart
and broad-shouldered as he was, did not top
the highest roll of her dark hair.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” His hand lingered
on her shoulder. “Don’t you feel well?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—pretty well.”</p>

<p>“Did you get the package I sent by express?”</p>

<p>“Yes; what to do with all those volumes
I do not know. It is so inconsiderate of you
when——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean the books—and I
stopped at the carpenter’s; he is going to
make shelves for them. But I meant the
other package.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any other package.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there was”—his arm was still half
around her. “I sent you—why here’s the
expressman now. Hi! This is the place;
yes, bring it here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>He came back again to his wife. “There
was a little debt paid me yesterday. After
I got the books, I thought I’d buy a present
for you.” He pressed her shoulder gently.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Something you’ve been wanting a long
time, something you’ll like. It’s the large
rug for the parlour.”</p>

<p>“The rug—Nevin, you <em>didn’t</em> get a rug
without <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find it’s all right when you see it.
Stand off a moment”—he was disposing of
the knotted cords with sharp clicks of his
penknife. “I’ll spread it out for you. There—what
do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“What did you pay for it?” asked Mrs.
Thatcher in an odd voice.</p>

<p>“Not much, considering what it’s worth,”
said her husband, still exuberant. “It’s
genuine something or other, I forget what.
I got it at a bargain at a place down-town
where they are selling off. It took my eye
the moment I saw it. What’s the matter,
Mildred? Don’t you like it?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s very nice,” said Mrs. Thatcher,
trying to keep rein on her feelings. “Only
<em>of course</em>, those reds and yellows don’t go
with anything that we have; it would look
perfectly dreadful with the old rose wallpaper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, I don’t see that it would.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thatcher was still lovingly regarding
the article in question, stretched out in the
hall. “They put all kinds of colours together
nowadays. Here, let me set it out
where it belongs, and see if you don’t think
it looks all right.”</p>

<p>He switched a chair or two out of the way,
moved back the tea-table, and stretched the
rug down on the open space on the floor.
He stood off admiringly. “Now, don’t you
think that’s fine? Why don’t you speak?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nevin, it’s <em>too</em> dreadful! Can’t you
see? It’s a disgrace, a perfect disgrace. I
wouldn’t have any one I cared for come into
the house with that thing on the floor; I
don’t know <em>what</em> they’d think of me.” Her
voice had gone beyond control, and rose
more and more hysterical.</p>

<p>“Oh, how <em>could</em> you be mean enough to
go and buy a rug without me—something
I’d set my <em>heart</em> on. A rug, of all <em>things</em>,
that you have to live with always! And I
had been looking forward so to choosing it
with you! Why didn’t you tell me about it?
It’s so terrible, it’s so <em>common</em>——”</p>

<p>“‘Common!’ Now you don’t know what
you’re talking about.” Mr. Thatcher’s confidence
in the pleasing powers of his purchase
died hard. “It’s genuine—I forget just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
what, but it <em>is</em> genuine. I thought you’d
know.”</p>

<p>“I <em>do</em> know—it’s one of the cheapest kinds
there are. Nevin, I can’t have it in here, you
<em>must</em> understand that. Why, I couldn’t eat
my meals if I had to look in and see it.
Can’t you take it back and change it?”</p>

<p>“Change it!”</p>

<p>Mildred had known, even as she spoke,
that the suggestion was unforgivable. She
could go to town merrily, day after day, exchanging
goods, but her husband would have
felt like a sneak thief if he had taken anything
back to “change it.”</p>

<p>“No, I can <em>not</em>!” His anger was at last
aroused, and thoroughly. “If you don’t like
the thing you can chuck it out into the street,
for all I care. I tried to give you a pleasure,
and this is what I get for it. I’ll never buy
you another thing as long as I live!”</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Mrs. Thatcher’s tongue
to say, “I hope you won’t,” but this time
something restrained her. There were but
few times that she had seen her husband as
angry as this, and never at her, though there
might have been more provocative occasions.
He had bought many things before which
she had not liked, without any real friction
between husband and wife—it was one of
“his” ways which they had often laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
over. But each day’s path is different from
that of yesterday—what has been a convenient
stone to rest on before becomes
unexpectedly a stumbling-block in the way.
Mr. Thatcher’s wrath, indeed, gathered its
greatest force from the underlying knowledge
that he might have done differently.</p>

<p>The subject was dropped at dinner, but
Mrs. Thatcher could not forbear beginning
on it again afterwards. Nevin <em>must</em> see how
dreadful it was to have that rug, if it was
properly put to him. But he stopped her
after the first tearful expostulations.</p>

<p>“Never say ‘rug’ to me again,” he commanded
briefly. “You’ve said too much
already.” He read a magazine all the evening,
and after a while she went up-stairs and
lay down on the edge of Bobby’s little bed,
beside her sleeping child, and wept.</p>

<p>It was unbelievable, unbearable, that he
could buy that horrible thing without her!
And there was no other place in the tiny
house to put it. When she looked at it in
the morning it was worse even than she had
dreamed—it put her teeth on edge. The
home didn’t seem like <em>hers</em>! She averted
her face from it patiently at breakfast, and
her mouth drooped pathetically, but Nevin
only read his paper and kissed her unseeingly
when he left. When he was gone, she and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Kitty rolled the rug up into a corner. If any
one came they could think she was cleaning
house.</p>

<p>And on the morrow, and the morrow after,
the rug, like a malevolent force, still separated
them. She would have given it away
if she could have afforded to have done so.
As time went on there was a certain change
in her own way of regarding it. Still she
had that choked sensation when she thought
of his going and buying it without her, but
she did not think of it as often. She began
to discern that she had lost something inconceivably
more precious than the sublimated
rug of her fancy. It was not only that Nevin
had no longer any desire to buy her anything,
but there was a subtle reservation of
spirit. In that fit of unreasoning passion she
had lost some attraction for him, some of
that aureole of romance which is at once the
most intangible and the dearest possession of
the married, for which a woman may indeed
keep her most shining thought, her sweetest
care. What was any rug compared with her
husband’s sentiment for her? Yet it was not
a mere rug to her, but one of the symbols of
a home. Did she love him ten times more,
the sight of that cheap and glaring inconsistency
would bring the vexed tears to her
eyes. She knew her limitations by instinct—it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
was no use to try and laugh at being
parted by a colour scheme—never could she
be heroically strong enough to move and
have her being as if the rug were not there.</p>

<p>For nine days Mildred Thatcher lived as
her neighbours, a life as thick and solid, as
uninformed with the spirit as the rubber plant
which stood neglected in the drawing-room
by the pile of books—as yet unshelved—and
the dusty upright piano. The palms had
gone to the florist’s, and she had no heart
to take the rubber plant in and out each day.
She did not care whether the thing died or
not. She did not care for anything. Every
night when Nevin came home, she greeted
him as calmly and affectionately as he greeted
her, and waited, tingling, for developments
which never came. The rug, which dominated
her every waking moment, had, indeed,
been almost forgotten by him—pressed out
of sight, as is a man’s wont with disagreeable
domestic happenings, only the unpleasant
impression remaining. He read or went to
sleep on the sofa, and they both spent some
evenings out. After a week had passed, and
while Mildred was waiting for the change in
her husband’s manner, it suddenly came over
her with a strange shock that he was not
only losing his delicate perception of her,
but that he was growing content without it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
It is so easy to lapse to the lower level!
They were getting into the rut that only
grows the deeper with travel.</p>

<p>Then there came a day when Mrs. Thatcher
could stand it no longer. She had a consultation
with Mrs. Brereton, and the next
morning the latter came over and the two
talked further with great animation over the
rug in the little drawing-room. After that
Mrs. Thatcher dressed herself with unusual
care. She put on her new dark blue suit
and a hat that her husband always admired,
although it was not quite in the fashion. She
looked at herself again and again in the glass
before she started for the train, giving a
touch here and a touch there with nervous
fingers. She could not wait for her husband
to come home, even if she had been less painfully
aware of her new powerlessness in the
conventional surroundings. She must venture
into new scenes if she would gain what
she wanted. And she could not stand this a
minute longer—she must end it all <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>Yet, her heart was beating painfully as she
neared the city, and she was only somewhat
reassured by the glimpse in the ferry-boat
mirror of a tall, slender-throated woman with
soft, pale cheeks and a curved mouth, her
dark eyes gazing indifferently before her
under a hat whose cherry wreath drooped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
against her dark hair, and who turned out
to be herself. If she really looked like
that——</p>

<p>Her hand lingered on the knob of the
ground-glass door that led to the office of
her husband’s factory. Then she opened it.</p>

<p>“Nevin!”</p>

<p>Her husband, broad and square-shouldered,
was standing over another man’s desk, beyond,
talking. There were lines of care on
his forehead, and a pencil behind his ear—he
was the man of business, not her husband.</p>

<p>He looked up amazed as he saw his wife,
but came forward at once.</p>

<p>“Why, <em>Mildred</em>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nevin, I hope you don’t mind! I’ve
been feeling so dreadfully, I couldn’t stand it
a moment longer. I’ve something—something
to tell you.”</p>

<p>She began to shake a little, her lip trembled,
her eyes looked appealingly at him like
a child’s. Her husband had always known
as a matter of course that she was beautiful,
but her beauty came now like a surprise in the
dingy surroundings of the factory office, with
the whirr of the planing machines beyond.
His eyes met the appeal in hers with a smile
that set her pulse beating anew, as he said:</p>

<p>“What is it? Hadn’t you better sit
down?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no! Not yet. Maybe you won’t
want me to—— Oh, Nevin, I’ve been trying
to tell you every night lately how sorry
I was—I’d acted so—about the rug—and I
couldn’t! You wouldn’t give me a chance.”</p>

<p>The well-known stiffness came over him—a
shadow of the past shade.</p>

<p>“That’s of no consequence—don’t let’s talk
about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>please</em>—I must! Oh, Nevin, I hope
you won’t mind. I knew I couldn’t be decent
while the rug was there. I’m so frightfully
narrow-minded—things make me horrid
even when I don’t want to be. I’ve—I’ve
sold it.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sold</em> it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Mrs. Brereton bought it for her
brother-in-law’s room. She didn’t pay quite
as much as you did—you left the price mark
on—but she said you were cheated.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> don’t care what you do with it. I
thought it was a pretty good sort, myself.”</p>

<p>“It was a <em>lovely</em> rug,” said Mrs. Thatcher
earnestly, “only it wasn’t in the right place.
It was just what Mrs. Brereton wanted—for
her brother-in-law. But it seemed so mean
of me to sell it—when it was your present—and
I’ve been so unhappy lately—Nevin—you
<em>can’t think</em>!”</p>

<p>Her eyes brimmed as she gazed at him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the red cherries in her hat shook against the
dark hair that framed her soft, pale cheeks.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said Mr. Thatcher briefly,
pushing a wooden armed office chair towards
her. He went away momentarily, and then
came back. “Have you had your lunch?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Mrs. Thatcher faintly.</p>

<p>“Well, neither have I. I think you’d be
better for something to eat. You wait five
minutes and I’ll be ready to go out with you.
We’ll have a little lunch together.”</p>

<p>She raised her drooping head to give him
the wistfully pleased, half-encouraged look
of one dependent on a benign higher power.
Her heart was swelling with the joy of
triumph.</p>

<p>When he returned to her with his overcoat,
he had been brushed clear of the factory
dust and looked trim and smiling, hat in
hand.</p>

<p>“It’s nearly two o’clock. I think I won’t
come back here this afternoon; I’ve got
through about all there is to do. It’s a dull
day. I’m going to take you around to the
Electrographic Club to lunch; they’ve got a
new room for ladies. You’d like to see the
pictures there. Come on—this way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely!” said Mrs. Thatcher,
with a deep, contented sigh. “How <em>good</em>
you are, Nevin! Do I look all right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll do,” said her husband, with
an affectionate squeeze of the arm next him.
“See here! You mustn’t look at me in the
street that way; people will think we’re engaged.”</p>

<p>“Well, why not?” murmured Mrs. Thatcher.
“I don’t care what anybody thinks—Darling!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Yes, my husband selected it,” said Mildred.
The next door neighbour was standing
in Mrs. Thatcher’s little drawing-room
with her, and they were both looking down
at a dark velvety rug with an Oriental blend
of colours in it. “It was a present to me,
but he wouldn’t <em>think</em> of getting it alone—though
he has such excellent taste. We
made quite a little event of buying it yesterday.”</p>

<p>“It is beautiful,” said the neighbour, with
a regretful sigh. “How dry that rubber plant
looks; it needs water. Why don’t you have
it outdoors?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have it out all the time,” asseverated
Mrs. Thatcher hastily. “At least, <em>nearly</em>
all the time. Lately I’ve forgotten to see
about it. I’ve been so—so <em>busy</em>. Why, I do
believe there’s a new green leaf coming out
at the top!”</p>

<p>“Rubber plants can stand a great deal,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
said the neighbour philosophically, following
Mrs. Thatcher, who was lugging the heavy
pot out into the wooing breeze of the late
afternoon. She was so touchingly happy that
she felt as if she could have lifted mountains.</p>

<p>She stood and looked down the elm-shaded
street, through which the footsteps of her beloved
would soon be hastening to her. The
department store wagons were still rattling
up and down, delivering relays and relays of
parcels at the different houses, and here and
there weary, draggled-looking women were
returning from town, each carrying by one
end the large paper bag which contains an
untrimmed hat. You could tell by the way
they walked that their feet hurt. Down the
block the freshening palms and rubber plants
were grouped at intervals. On Mrs. Thatcher’s
piazza, the emblem of a much-enduring domesticity
once more stood in the sunshine,
stolid and green.</p>

<h3>The Terminal</h3>

<p>It was Saturday night—the married
“drummer’s” homesick night. Mr.
Martin Prescott, walking into the long,
narrow hotel bedroom, felt more than ever
the wearing familiarity of the scene that met
his eye. There were the same dull carpet,
the Michigan pine furniture, the drab striped
wallpaper, the windows shaded only by little
slatted inside shutters, to which he was used
in third-rate towns. There was even the
same indefinable chill, dusty smell that was
associated with evenings of figuring over
sales on the coverless table, under the weak,
single-armed gas burner that jutted out
from the wall at the side of the bureau.
Yet, cheerless as it was, he preferred its
seclusion just now to the more convivial bar-room,
where the liquor and the jokes and
the conversation of “the boys” had all the
same jading flavour, and he felt unequal to
bracing his spirit sufficiently to receiving
the Saturday confidences of the garrulous
or the weary. Reticent both by habit and
principle as to his intimate affairs, he was no
stranger to his kind, and in the top strata of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
his mind were embedded many curious evidences
of other men’s lives.</p>

<p>But to-night he had a matter on his mind
that companied him whether he would or no,
and he was sore at having to stay over in
this little town, from which there was egress
once only in twenty-four hours. He had
waited for a customer who did not arrive in
the place until too late for him to get out
of it, and had hereby missed the letter from
his wife which was waiting for him some
hundred miles further westward. Prescott
did not, in a way, dislike travelling as a
business; his wife always comforted herself
with the thought that there were other
modes of earning a living more inherently
disagreeable to him, yet there were days
and nights of a paucity which he was glad
she could not picture. Saturday night away
from home in this kind of a town, without
a letter—when the last one had been disquieting—reached
the limit of endurance.
He felt that he had travelled long enough.</p>

<p>He made his preparations for the evening
with the wontedness of custom. He locked
the door, turned up the gas, and worked
over the screw in the lukewarm radiator.
Then he drew the cane-bottomed rocking-chair
underneath the gas burner, and placed
a couple of magazines on the bureau beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
him, his lean, bearded face reflected in the
shadowy mirror above it. He opened his
valise and took from it a folding leather
photograph case containing the picture of a
woman and three children. Prescott gazed
at it hard for a few moments before standing
it up beside the magazines. He was trying
to find an answer to the question he was
debating: if he could manage in some way
to supplement by three hundred dollars more
the income of a new position offered him, he
might be able to accept it and stay at home
for ever.</p>

<p>He lit his pipe and, putting his heavily
booted feet on a chair, began to cut the
leaves of a magazine with his pocket-knife.
He had meant to get his slippers out of the
bag and make himself comfortable, but
somehow, after looking at the photographs,
he had forgotten about himself. He had
written his daily letter to his wife before the
last-going train, and he would not begin a
fresh sheet now—no matter what he wrote,
she would divine his mood. You have to
be very careful what you write in a letter
that is read some days after, lest you cloud
the sunshine for another when it has brightened
again for you.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>He sprang up as a knock came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
door, after first hastily sweeping the photograph
case into the valise. He hoped devoutly
that it was not a visitor; there was no
one in this town whose presence would not
be an intrusion to-night. But he gave a glad
start of surprise as his eyes fell on the man
standing with the bell-boy in the hall.</p>

<p>“Brenner! Well, this <em>is</em> good! I never
dreamed of seeing <em>you</em> here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder,” said the stranger, a
pleasant, fresh-faced, broad-shouldered young
fellow, with a light mustache. “It’s ages
since I set eyes on you; I changed my route,
and then, two years ago, I married. We
only moved here last spring. Jim Halliday
told me this afternoon that you were in town.
What a soak he is! But don’t let’s waste
time here; I want you to come right around
and spend the evening at our house; I want
you to meet my wife.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be delighted,” said Prescott with alacrity.
He locked the bedroom door and the
two walked out together, conversing briskly
as they went. He and the younger Brenner
had been chance companions on several notable
trips in former years, drawn together in
spite of dissimilarities in taste and education
by a certain clear and simple cleanness of
mind which unerringly divines its kin. The
air had seemed raw and chill earlier, but good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
fellowship had put its warmth into the winter
world with Brenner’s presence.</p>

<p>“So you’re married,” said Prescott presently.
“I remember that I heard of it. I’ve
wondered at not meeting you anywhere; I
didn’t know you’d given up the road.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I’ve quit,” said Brenner. “My
wife didn’t like me to be away so much, used
to get scared nights, and there’s a sight of
things to see to when you have a house—the
coal, you know, and the plumbing getting
out of order, and then after the boy came—oh,
yes, I’ve quit it all right. Seems sort of
tied down in a way after you’ve been your
own boss, but I’m not sorry—I’m pretty well
fixed, I guess. Travelling’s all very well for
a single man, but it gets to be an awful pull
after you’re married. You miss a lot.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been travelling for sixteen years,”
said Prescott soberly; “two years before I
married—at twenty-four—and fourteen since.”</p>

<p>“That so? It’s a pretty long time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. I’ve been wanting to give it
up.” He hesitated, and then continued with
rare expansiveness: “The fact is, there’s a
position open for me at home now, but I can’t
quite see my way clear to taking it. The
salary’s nominally all right, but there’s my
living to be taken into account, and other
things. I figure out that it would mean about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
three hundred dollars a year less than we
have now—and I don’t see how we could live
on that. You see, the trouble is it’s away out
of the line I’m in now—yet there <em>may</em> be a
future in it.”</p>

<p>He went into explanatory detail, led on by
Brenner’s questioning interest.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you make it up in any way by
outside commissions?”</p>

<p>Prescott nodded. “Ah, that’s what I’m
trying to get at. You’re a wise man to have
made the break early, Brenner. Every year
I’ve meant to.” Prescott spoke with a bitter
patience. “I’ve never thought of my being
on the road as anything but temporary, and
here I’m at it still. The longer you wait, the
harder it gets to change; you don’t know
how to take the risk. I haven’t told my wife
yet about this offer, for I don’t want to disappoint
her. I hoped to have had a letter
from her to-night—the last one was rather
disquieting—but I’m behind my schedule.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know what that is,” said Brenner
heartily. “I had a letter from Mame once
after we were first married—she’d cried all
over the paper in big blots; she thought she’d
die before morning. Well, my train was
snowed up in a South Dakota blizzard and I
never got another letter for a week. <em>Holy
smoke!</em> I never want to go through that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
kind of a racket again. Then, when I <em>did</em>
hear, I found she’d been to a party the next
evening as chipper as you please—belle of
the ball. I tell you there’s too much seesaw
about that sort of thing for a limited nature
like mine; but I suppose I’d have got used
to teetering on it same as the rest of you, only
she made up her mind I was to quit—and
quit I did. Mame runs <em>me</em>! I guess she’ll
try and run you too; she tries to run most
any one that comes to hand. This is my
shebang.”</p>

<p>He stopped before a small cottage whose
slender piazza was ornamentally fenced in
with heavy wooden scroll work, and, opening
the front door, ushered the guest into the
narrow hall. “Hello, Mame! Here’s Prescott.
Prescott—he’s one of ‘the boys,’ you
know.”</p>

<p>“We’re so glad to have you here,” said
Mrs. Brenner, a stout young woman in a light
blue flannel shirt-waist; she had prettily untidy
hair, large gentle brown eyes, and small,
very soft hands. She brushed the light
strands of hair out of the way with a pretty
gesture of one hand, while she extended the
other to Prescott. He felt an instant sensation
of comfort, increased when he found
himself finally settled in an armchair in a
room that reflected the mistress of it in a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of warm, attractive disorderliness. A work-basket,
with the sewing half out of it, occupied
a footstool; the table, lighted by a lamp
with a pictorial shade, was piled high with
magazines and papers; a banjo sprawled on
the sofa amid the tumbled pillows, and a
child’s pink worsted sock and a china cat lay
in front of the bright little kerosene stove in
the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brenner followed his gaze towards the
infant’s belongings and blushed as she
laughed.</p>

<p>“Harve won’t let me pick them up! Isn’t
it silly of him?”</p>

<p>“I believe she puts them there herself, because
she thinks I like it,” said Brenner
serenely. “Oh, she’s up to tricks! She sent
me for you to-night. Do you remember the
evening I spent at your house five years ago?
The night I had the cold, and your wife put
the mustard plaster on me?”</p>

<p>“Why so she did,” said Prescott delightedly.
“I’d forgotten you’d seen my wife and the
children. Let me see—there were only two
of them—Margaret’s four years old.”</p>

<p>“It was the hottest mustard plaster I ever
felt,” said Brenner reminiscently. “I went
to sleep with it on. When I woke up—I
guess I was sort of dazed—I thought the
house was on fire, and started to run down-stairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
but Mrs. Prescott caught on in some
way, and sent you to head me off. Hottest
mustard plaster I <em>ever</em> felt. Well, your wife
was mighty good to me. Not so very rugged-looking
though herself, as I remember.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s very strong,” said Prescott,
with defensive hauteur; “very. She’s never
ill.” He turned the conversation towards the
Brenner ménage. “And how old is your
child?”</p>

<p>But he found himself, later, confiding in
Mrs. Brenner, after the cozy little supper in
the rag-carpeted dining-room, where she had
set out hot mince pie and cheese and cookies,
and Brenner had made the coffee. Prescott,
who owned the impaired digestion of the travelling
man, had long passed the stage of taking
whiskey to supplement all deficiencies,
arriving at the final attitude of the invariable
soft boiled eggs for breakfast and rare roast
beef for dinner, but to-night he had recklessly
refused to take sickly thought for the morrow.
Mame’s pie was good.</p>

<p>Brenner was sitting now cross-legged on
the sofa, strumming obliviously on the banjo,
while Prescott, his arms on the dining-table,
leaned towards Mrs. Brenner’s sympathy.
Something in this warm home atmosphere
was too much for him.</p>

<p>“She—I—there’re some things you can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
talk about, Mrs. Brenner. Now, the other
night my wife had to get up at two o’clock
in the morning and go out over the snow to
the doctor’s; Martin, that’s my boy, was
taken sick. Little Emma wouldn’t let her
mother go alone—she’s only nine. My wife
wrote me that it didn’t scare her a bit, but it
does seem sort of pitiful—doesn’t it?—to
think of their doing it. It’s never happened
before, but the neighbours we used to have
moved away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mind it more than she would,”
said Mrs. Brenner encouragingly. Her soft
eyes made a temporary home for him.</p>

<p>“Things seem to tell on her more than they
used, though she tries hard not to let me see
it. She’s always worrying about me, in this
kind of weather, for fear I’ll come down with
something alone in a hotel. But my wife”—Prescott
paused a moment awkwardly—“my
wife’s awfully <em>good</em>; I’m not that way myself,
Mrs. Brenner, but I don’t think I would
care for a woman that wasn’t religious. She
thinks everything is <em>meant</em>. And it helps her
a lot.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Mrs. Brenner. She
added after a little silence: “Was your boy
very ill?”</p>

<p>“Ill? No; he was all right the next day.
But she caught cold; she doesn’t think enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of herself; she’s that kind, you know. It’s
clear foolishness! Last time I was home I
found that when the girl left—we had one for
six years and have been changing hoodlums
every fifteen minutes since she married—well,
when the last one left I found she’d been carrying
up the coal for the fires because the
boy got tired, and she was afraid it would
hurt him. Husky little beggar, I’d tire him
all right! He’s just getting to the age when
he’s too much for his mother—nothing wrong
about him, but he worries her. He slings his
books at the brakemen when he goes in to
school on the train and gets complained of—and
he smokes cigarettes around the corner
and the neighbours come and tell her, and it
breaks her all up.”</p>

<p>“He needs a man,” said Mrs. Brenner.</p>

<p>“Yes. But you see I’m home so seldom
she can’t bear to have me down on the children
the only time I’m with them. You see,
a man doesn’t think much whether he likes to
travel or not—it’s just something that’s got
to be done, if you’re in the business—but it’s
hard on a woman. Some women seem to get
used to it, though.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” murmured Mrs. Brenner, “when
we married I said to my husband: ‘When I
get over caring for you, then I’ll get over
minding your leaving me—and not before.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, that’s what my wife says!” said
Prescott. He laughed, with a rising colour,
and shook his head. “You women—you’re
all alike. You don’t know what lots of good
it’s done me to be here and talk to you to-night;
it’s most as good as being home—not
quite, though.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you stop travelling?” said Mrs.
Brenner, going with penetrative instinct to
the thought she felt. She added, after a
pause: “Are you sure you can’t?”</p>

<p>He looked at her uncertainly. “How did
you know that? No, I’m not sure I can’t—but
I’m not sure I can. And I’m not so young
as I was.”</p>

<p>“Think of it.” Her hand gave his a warm
clasp; through her eyes he saw his wife.
“<em>Think</em> of it.”</p>

<p>“God knows I do,” said Prescott huskily.
His hand wrenched hers in its farewell, before
he put on the overcoat Brenner brought
him from the back hall.</p>

<p>All the way back to the hotel he was thinking
over things. It all depended on that few
hundred dollars extra, so absolutely necessary
that, without it, he could not provide a shelter
for his family. More than a living he no
longer planned for. He looked at the future
with the eye of the man who, whatever his
abilities, has come to learn that, either from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
early training, or environment, or the iron
bands of need, more than a careful living can
never be his. He could have enjoyed riches
as well and more than many another man,
but they were so out of all calculation that
what they could buy no longer aroused in
him any particular interest. He would never
even be able to indulge in that pathetically
ludicrous dream of the business man of retiring
to a green and placid land and raising
catalogue produce from theory. He would
be able to save little, after educating his children,
but the money to pay the insurance that
would keep his wife from penury when he
died. For all his days he must work in harness,
and take no holiday but that which Death
gives to the great rank and file.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of these limitations, for all that
he tacitly renounced, he had good measure.
He had the freedom of spirit which belongs
to him who, given a competence, envies not
any man his wealth or his opportunity. He
had gained a capacity for getting great and
far-reaching happiness from the exquisite little
joys of life. If he had a little of the inner
sadness that comes of foregoing the ambitions
natural to a man, it was not the sadness of
defeat, but rather the thoughtful weighing of
the loss as the least—all things considered—that
he could have had. In the silent times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of those long journeyings by day and night
over the earth, the pricelessness of the common
blessing of a home had sunk deeper and
deeper into his soul. And the spring of all
this was in the love he and his wife had for
each other, a love that was too much of a
vital power to be consciously dwelt upon; it
was rather an enlarging and enriching of the
whole nature because they two were one in
the possession of a country which it is given
to but few of the married to see even afar off.
Below all trouble lay ever a secret joy;
whither he went, she companied him. In all
the years of separation, they were less apart
than many whose hands meet daily; there
could be no real separation between them
even after death.</p>

<p>But now—but now—she was getting tired.
Her small face with its pure outlines, the
sweet, nervous mouth and the loving eyes
came before him—her low controlled voice,
her quick motions, her rapid adjustment of
all domestic problems that his brief stay at
home might be bright and restful, the children
at their best, the meals most home-like,
and she herself dressed prettily, with the work
so ordered that she might not lose a minute
of his society. If callers came on one of
those precious afternoons, she rebelled as if
at a calamity. She had always been so brave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
so helpful, but she was not so strong as she
had been, and the boy was too much for her.
If he could but see his way a little clearer!
He had the cautiousness of methods new to
him that comes of the inexperience of manhood,
far more frustrating than the inexperience
of the boy.</p>

<p>Brenner came around the next day just
before train time.</p>

<p>“Mame sent me,” he explained. “She’s
been talking to me ever since you left. She’s
got a brother in New York who’s in the line
you’re looking up, and she has an idea you
can fix up something with him in connection
with the position you were telling me of. If
you can carry some of his business with
you I don’t see but it would help you out
mighty well. He’s a good man—and he’ll
do anything for Mame, if he <em>can</em> do it.
She’s written him a letter, and here’s one for
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged, I’m sure,” said Prescott
politely. He did not speak with enthusiasm;
he had a rooted distaste for a
woman’s intervention in business matters, and
by daylight his evening confidences rather
annoyed him. Still——</p>

<p>“A telegram for you, sir,” said a boy, coming
up.</p>

<p>Prescott took it and opened it mechanically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
He stood for a moment with his eyes glued
to the paper, and when he looked up Brenner
cried in horror:</p>

<p>“Not your <em>wife</em>, man!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Prescott thickly. “It’s little
Margaret.” He consulted the paper. “She’s
not dead—yet. She’s been run over. She
may not be so badly hurt as they fear. My
God! I can’t get there for two days!”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven the east-bound train’s on
time,” said Brenner devoutly, and went home
to be cheered by his Mame.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Papa is to carry little Margaret up-stairs—think
of it!—dear papa to carry her—such
a treat! His arms are so much stronger than
mamma’s.” It was a week since the day of
the telegram.</p>

<p>“Mamma jiggles,” said the child roguishly,
looking backward from the shelter of her
father’s arms to the slender figure toiling
up laboriously with shawls and pillows.
“Mamma carries Marget all slippy.”</p>

<p>“Poor mamma,” said the father; “she
has to do everything when I’m not here.”
He pressed his lips to the soft baby cheek
of the little girl who was getting well, but
his thought was with the mother. “Now
what on earth are you lugging all those
things up for, Annie? Didn’t I tell you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
call Martin to take them? You know you’re
all worn out.”</p>

<p>“He’s reading, and I thought I wouldn’t
disturb him.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that magazine I had? <em>There</em>
you go again! Why <em>don’t</em> you let the children
wait on you?”</p>

<p>“I knew <em>just</em> where it was,” said the wife
with eager excuse.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s their business to know where
things are,” said Prescott severely; “they
don’t help you half enough. When I go
away to-morrow——”</p>

<p>The joy in his wife’s face went out as the
light is snuffed out in a candle.</p>

<p>That evening, as they sat alone together
in the cozy library after the children were
in bed, she broke into the conversation
with a tone that showed the effort. “I
haven’t asked you yet what time you want
breakfast to-morrow morning. I hope you
don’t have to take the six-fifty, it’s so very
dark and early, and you never really eat anything,
no matter what I get for you.”</p>

<p>Prescott looked at the pure outline of her
cheek and brow, and the stricken cheerfulness
of her eyes. He hardly seemed to hear
her words for a minute, and then answered
absently:</p>

<p>“No; I’m not going so early to-morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Hark, is that somebody coming up our
steps?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I <em>hope</em> it’s no one to call! It would
be dreadful when it’s our last evening together.
No, thank goodness! It’s next
door.”</p>

<p>“When I’ve been home five whole days
that you didn’t count on, you oughtn’t to
stand out for such a little thing as the last
evening. It was well I could come—wasn’t
it? When I got that telegram——”</p>

<p>He broke off with a shudder, and their
hands clasped. Their minds traversed the
past week with its terror and anxiety, and
its later joy—the great happiness which
comes from no new phase, but from the
blessed continuance of the unnoticed daily
good.</p>

<p>“You have been in town so much of the
time,” she murmured half-jealously.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. It was necessary.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me yet what time you
want your breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, any old time. I don’t think I’ll go
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say so before?” She
looked at him reproachfully. “Then I would
have hired Maria for the day. Now I’ll have
to spend a lot of time in the kitchen when I’ll
want to be with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“How would you behave if I were to stay
home all the time?”</p>

<p>“How would I behave?” She gleamed
at him with sudden sweet tremulous humour
through the mistiness of her eyes. “I’d
never come near you. I’d make calls and
belong to all the societies in the place and
not get back until after dinner-time. I’d go
next door in the evening and leave you
home reading. I’d behave the way other
women do whose husbands come home
every night. I expect I’d get tired of seeing
you around. Don’t you believe it?” The
gaiety in her tone flickered and went out, as
if she were very, very tired. Her voice
dropped to a whisper. “I know you’ve
been considering that offer—<em>you</em> didn’t tell
me of it—and you’ve refused it. I’ve been
watching you. And I don’t see how I’m going
to let you go this time.”</p>

<p>“Annie!”</p>

<p>“Oh, forgive, forgive me! I’ll be brave
again, I will indeed. But I’ve been through
so much lately that just now—it gets so hard—so
hard”—her voice was almost inaudible—“harder
and harder. I’ve been praying—and
<em>praying</em>.”</p>

<p>“Annie, dear, you’re all wrong. I’m not
going to-morrow or Tuesday either. Can’t
you guess?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>She lifted her head from his shoulder and
pushed him from her. “How queer you act!
What do you <em>mean</em>?”</p>

<p>He tried to bend a jovial gaze upon her.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to travel any more, Annie,
ever. You were all wrong; I’ve taken the
offer. I went to see Mrs. Brenner’s brother
in town. I tell you that little woman in Wisconsin
did you a mighty good turn! And
I’ve taken the chances. I’ve figured it all
out.” He tried to gather her to him, but she
drew back. “Why, Annie, aren’t you glad?
What makes you shake so?”</p>

<p>“You are going to stay <em>now</em>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, always. I’m going to look after
my children and my—sweet—wife. Why
<em>Annie</em>! Oh, you poor, <em>poor</em> girl, has it been
as bad as <em>that</em>?”</p>

<p>He tried once more to draw her to him,
but she eluded his grasp and was gone. He
heard her light footfall above and then there
was only silence.</p>

<p>He sat there by the table for a few minutes
with a book before him, as he smoked, but
he did not read. Once he went to the door
and called “Annie!” softly, that little Margaret
might not be wakened, and yet again,
“Annie! Come down; I want to read to
you,” but there was no response.</p>

<p>He lingered a moment hesitatingly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
then went up the stairs himself, his feet
pausing half-reluctantly on the steps. Thrice
he halted, and then went on again into the
room where she was a kneeling figure by the
bed, her arms spread out upon it, and her
hair falling over her shoulders. She raised
her head momentarily with a backward glance
of rapt joy at him before burying it again in
the coverlet, and as his footfalls stopped on
the threshold she held out one arm appealingly
as if to encircle him beside her.</p>

<p>“No—no!” he said painfully. “No, Annie!
I—I can’t—it wouldn’t be right. Annie, you
don’t want <em>me</em>, dear; you don’t want—— <em>No!</em>”</p>

<p>Her white hand still mutely pleaded. Even
at the very gate of heaven she could not be
satisfied without him. He drew nearer, and
a little nearer. Then, somehow, he had stumbled
down awkwardly into the warm enclosure
of her arm, and hid his face within her
bosom.</p>

<h3>The Hinge</h3>

<p>“Mrs. Ranney is going away to-morrow
with the children to visit her
mother; did you hear that? It will
be a nice change for her, she’s alone so
much, with Mr. Ranney nearly every evening
at the Rowing Club or at that old hotel.
Goodness knows how late he’ll stay out after
she’s gone! I shouldn’t think she’d like it
<em>at all</em>.”</p>

<p>The four women who were neighbours on
the Ridge were coming back from a meeting
of the Vittoria Colonna Club, picking their
way in gala attire over the puddles left by a
shower, with the aid of the two parallel see-sawing
boards that made the suburban sidewalk.
Mrs. Stone, who had spoken, was tall
and large-featured; she wore a startlingly
wide, high-plumed hat that seemed to have
no connection with her head, rearing into
strange shapes with the wind that blew from
the sea.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she’s glad to have him out of
the house,” suggested the fair, prettily garbed
little Mrs. Spicer, who talked very fast. “Not
that he’s dissipated at all, I don’t mean that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but I think he’s one of those horrid domineering
men you’d hate to have around. I
don’t believe he ever gives her a cent of
money—<em>he</em> is always so well-dressed, but she
hasn’t had a new thing since she came here
a year ago. I’d like to see Ernest Spicer
treat me that way!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ranney says she likes him to take a
walk after dinner; that he’s used to it,” interpolated
the handsome, brown-eyed Mrs.
Laurence, with a characteristic lift of her
white chin. “He often asks her to go with
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, so she says!” Mrs. Stone made
a clutch for her hat. “Of course she <em>acts</em>
satisfied; you can’t tell anything by that.
She’s a dear little woman, but I don’t believe
there’s much to her; he’s a great deal
above her as far as brains go, that’s evident.
Keep over this side, Mrs. Spicer, that maple
is just dripping. But there’s very little
warmth or cordiality in Mrs. Ranney as far
as I can see; she doesn’t respond as you’d
think she would. I ran over the other day
when she happened to be out and Ann let
me see her preserve-closet. When I spoke
to her the next day about the number of jars
she had, she almost made me feel as if I had
been intrusive. Some people have that unvarying
manner, always pleasant but nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
more. It wears on <em>me</em>, I know, and I
shouldn’t wonder if it did on Mr. Ranney; I
think he feels a lack in her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s such a great subject!” said little
Mrs. Spicer with earnest volubility, “it’s
such a great subject, that of being attractive
to one’s husband. Miss Liftus spoke so feelingly
about it the other day at the Club, she
says that women are so engrossed in their
own affairs that they neglect to adapt themselves
to the husband’s life; she thinks intelligent
coöperation in business matters should
be the key-note. It’s a lovely idea; I know
a woman who is in her husband’s office, and
they enjoy it so much, but”—Mrs. Spicer
paused wistfully—“it’s very hard to help a
man when he’s in stocks, like Ernest Spicer;
I <em>can not</em> seem to remember quite what it is
when he’s on a margin; I’ve had it explained
to me so many times I am ashamed
to ask him any more; I seem to understand
it just for a minute, and then it goes. I
don’t know what’s the reason, but Ernest
never wants to talk about business with me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think husbands are very
different?” asked Mrs. Budd with a slow
distinctness, as if she were reading from a
primer; her large, unwavering blue eyes
pinned your butterfly attention fast in spite
of involuntary writhings. “I know my husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and Mr. Ranney are very different,
they like such different things for breakfast.
I am very particular about Mr. Budd’s meals,
and he depends so much on his breakfast.
He always begins on——”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you one thing,” interrupted
Mrs. Stone impatiently, she knew Mr. Budd’s
<em>ménu</em> by heart. “You can adapt and adapt
and they’ll never know it, but they do know
when they’re comfortable. Nobody can say
that Mr. Stone isn’t comfortable in his own
house. When I see a man like Mr. Ranney
leaving his home every evening you may be
sure there’s a screw loose somewhere. That
little woman is making a great mistake, but
it’s the kind of thing you’d find it difficult
to speak about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t speak about it for the
world!” cried Mrs. Laurence in horror.
“As Mrs. Budd says very truly, people are
so different.” Yet she found herself wondering
afterwards. She was sure that the
Ranneys were fond of each other in a way,
though she wouldn’t have cared for the way.
On what hinge hung Mr. Ranney’s neglect
of his wife? A lack in her, as Mrs. Stone
had said, selfishness on his part—coldness on
hers? Mrs. Laurence herself didn’t need to
discuss her attraction for Mr. Laurence—in
their case it was something inherent, not an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
accident of adjustment; it interpenetrated
every condition of life. She had put a blue
bow in her hair when she dressed, because
she had a theory that a woman should look
her nicest for her husband, but as a matter
of fact she knew that Will thought her beautiful
in anything she wore.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ranney always looked nice, there
could be no two opinions on that. She was
a slight, very young woman, with a heart-shaped,
childish face, that wore an expression
of gentle, matronly dignity, repelling to
familiarity. She had serious, flower-blue
eyes, and quantities of waving, chestnut-brown
hair coiled back so tightly from a
broad, low forehead that you hardly realized
at first that when it was let down it formed a
beautiful, shimmering cloak around her that
nearly touched the floor. Her whole personality
was intensely feminine. In any demand
of the day her simple gowns became
her, yet were never too fine for the work her
busy fingers found to do, for Mrs. Ranney
was a housewife and a sewer of garments;
she even helped vegetables as well as flowers
to grow with a quiet inborn capability that
showed in whatever she undertook. She
was known to be tender-hearted; the suffering
of others seemed to hurt her very flesh.
When that little bruiser, Herbert Ranney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
fell and bumped his head, Mrs. Ranney would
fly white and breathless from the house, and
clasp him to her breast in a wild effort to
fight off this thing that was attacking her
child. She couldn’t <em>stand</em> it that a child
should suffer.</p>

<p>Yet she had, at unexpected moments, a
roguish sense of humour that set her serious
blue eyes dancing mischievously; when she
got laughing, as had happened, half inaudibly,
so that she was helpless to stop
herself, she was as provocatively charming
as a lovely child. Her husband had been
once heard to state that he had never expected
to marry, having lived until the age
of thirty-six contentedly a bachelor, but that
when he met “that rascal there,” she bowled
him over on the spot. It certainly was a
fact that, though she was so hard to get
acquainted with, every man admired Mrs.
Ranney.</p>

<p>Women, as a rule, did not care much for
Mr. Ranney, perhaps, because he used towards
them a gallant deference so evidently
given them as a sex that it piqued by ignoring
any personal claim to his attention. In
appearance he was large and heavily built,
smooth-shaven, with fine intellectual features,
and hair and brows of blue black; his square
chin was almost aggressively assertive. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
man of semi-nautical tastes, he had at times
almost a quarter-deck manner alike to barking
dogs, poaching cows and trivial or unauthorized
approach from his fellows. With
the men who were his friends he was reputed
to be a charming companion, witty, genial,
and whole-hearted; the wives took the fact
on hearsay, with some suspicion. Mrs.
Laurence felt a distinct sense of resentment
as, sitting on her piazza after dinner she saw
him coming up the steps, natty and immaculate
in his blue flannels, pipe in hand—he
was actually going to leave his wife alone
on the eve of her departure. He doffed the
peaked, gold-banded cap of his boating club.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Mrs. Laurence. Is Laurence
anywhere around?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed, he’s never far off when
I’m here,” returned Mrs. Laurence incautiously,
with what she felt was almost too
much meaning for politeness; she saw Mr.
Ranney’s left eyebrow go up a little with
quizzical effect; it made her feel hot. “Your
wife leaves to-morrow, I believe. How is
she to-night after all her packing?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ranney is quite well, I think,” said
Mr. Ranney in a tone that in spite of its apparent
politeness placed a wedge between
himself and his personal affairs, though Mrs.
Laurence still persevered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will miss her dreadfully after she
goes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Minda will look after me,” said Mr.
Ranney coolly. Minda was a capable old
coloured woman who worked for the neighbourhood.
“Hello, Laurence!” His voice
changed to one of good fellowship. “Want
to walk down with me and take a look at
Harker’s boat?”</p>

<p>“No, I think I’d better not,” said Mr.
Laurence lingeringly, his long figure coming
into view in the semi-darkness of the summer
evening. He really did not care to go, “the
boys” bored him; an uncut magazine, with
his wife for audience had been pleasantly
ahead of him after the work of the day; yet
such is the power of attraction from man to
man, so much greater than that from woman
to woman, that he almost felt as if he wanted
to be Ranney’s companion if Ranney wanted
him. It was the Call of the Wild. Past experience
warned him clear of those mistakenly
jocular words, “my wife won’t let me”—he
put his hand caressingly on the back of her
chair as he said: “I don’t think I’ll leave
Anna this evening, we’re finishing a serial
together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” responded Mr. Ranney.
He put on his cap as he went down the steps
again, lit his pipe, and walked off with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
air of jaunty and masterful freedom that in
its way was an offense to the marital traditions
of the street; it subtly discredited his wife, it
seemed to undermine the generous, dual obligations
of a home. And to-night——</p>

<p>“<em>Pig!</em>” said Mrs. Laurence, with an indignation
that hurled the adjective after him like
a stone. “If you didn’t consider me any
more than that, Will—— Wait a moment.”
She ran impulsively over to the next house,
quickly forestalling the invitation she saw on
Mrs. Ranney’s lips, as the latter came to the
door in her white gown, a book in her hand.</p>

<p>“No, I thank you, I can’t come in—Mr.
Laurence is waiting for me at home. How
tired you look! <em>Won’t</em> you come over and
sit with us a while? We’d love so much to
have you—and I’ll make some lemonade.
We feel that we won’t see anything of you
for so long.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” said Mrs. Ranney.
She looked surprised. “You’re very kind,
but I think I’ll stay here and rest, if you
don’t mind; I thought I’d just read a little
before I went to bed; you see I have everything
packed, and we don’t go until after
lunch to-morrow.” She seemed to cast around
for something more to say. “I read a good
deal in the evenings when Mr. Ranney is out;
I haven’t any time during the day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“It takes a great deal of time to keep
up with the magazines,” sympathized Mrs.
Laurence.</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about the magazines—Mr.
Ranney doesn’t care for them. I’ve
been reading the Bible through this year, I
always intended to when I had a chance,”
said Mrs. Ranney simply. “I found it very
interesting. Mr. Ranney thinks a good deal
of Homer, too; I’ve just finished the ‘Odyssey.’
<em>Won’t</em> you come in?”</p>

<p>“No, no, I can’t,” returned Mrs. Laurence
hastily. “Is that the ‘Iliad’ you have there?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Ranney. Her eyes
gleamed dancingly with sudden mischief;
she leaned forward with roguish defiance.
“I’ll tell you what this is—it’s the ‘Thompson
Street Poker Club!’” She relapsed
into one of her lovely, helpless fits of half-inaudible
laughter in which Mrs. Laurence
joined perforce, and the two women held on
to each other for mutual support, in feminine
fashion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ranney went away the next day at
one o’clock, trim and pretty in her blue travelling
suit; the women who flocked to bid her
good-bye were profuse in offers of caring for
Mr. Ranney, but she only thanked them with
gentle unresponsiveness, and said that Minda
would look after him quite well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>It was strange what a difference her departure
seemed to make at once in the aspect
of the little house; a shadow had fallen over
it, a visible grayness of desolation touched it,
mistlike; the embowering vines drooped like
the adjuncts of a cemetery; there was a
curious deadness about the very hang of the
curtains, one could see from without, and the
half-lowered shades. The very fact of the
front doors being closed set the seal of
strangeness upon it. A spirit, so vitally
sweet, so informing that even inanimate objects
reflected it, had departed and left only
the cold and empty shell behind, not alone
to the intimate heart, but to even the casual
observer.</p>

<p>“Really, I hate to look over there,” confided
Mrs. Spicer to Mrs. Stone. “Minda
came into our kitchen a while ago, she said
she could hardly stay in the place, she felt
just as if Mrs. Ranney and the children were
dead. I’m sorry she felt that way. I had the
most peculiar feeling myself when I saw her
go. Forebodings are so—— Well, of course,
you don’t believe in them, but you don’t like
them. I’ve just taken some of my nerve tonic.
I can hardly blame Mr. Ranney if he stays
out till all hours now.”</p>

<p>The watching neighbourhood could hardly
believe it when eight o’clock struck—half-past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
eight—and no Mr. Ranney walked
jauntily down the street, immaculately attired,
with his gold-banded yachting cap on
the side of his head. He was known to have
come home to his dinner, and afterwards the
smoke of his pipe had risen from the verandah.
Laurence, urged thereto by his wife, lounged
finally up to the door-step to find Ranney sitting
there in a disreputable pongee coat, with
an old, gray felt basin on his head, smoking,
with his shoulders hunched forward and his
eyes fixed sombrely before him. He only
nodded at Laurence’s greeting, and made
room on the steps beside him.</p>

<p>“There’s a chair up there, if you want it.”</p>

<p>“No, this does well enough,” said Laurence.
“How is the election going on?”</p>

<p>“The election?” Mr. Ranney’s eyes sought
for a connecting clue. “Oh, yes, of course,
the Club election. I don’t know how it’s
getting on, I don’t care a hang how it goes.
Did you see the weather report to-night,
Laurence? They say there’s a storm brewing
up the coast, where my wife’s gone.
Those steamers are nothing but rotten old
tubs; it’s only a question when they’ll go
to Davy Jones if a storm hits them. The
<em>Peerless</em> foundered three years back, you
remember. When I think of that girl and
her two babies out there to-night in that old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
<em>Patriot</em>, with nothing but a plank between
them and the bottom—I tell you I’ll be glad
to get a wire to-morrow night and know
they’re all right. I’ve gone all to pieces
thinking of it; lost my nerve completely.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t they have gone by rail?” asked
Mr. Laurence practically.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they could, but—they’d have to
stop off on the way, and then—— Well, I
<em>wanted</em> her to, but she thought it took too
much money.”</p>

<p>“But if you insisted on her taking it?”</p>

<p>“Insisted on her taking it! Why, man
alive, she has it all, that’s the trouble; I
hand all the funds over to that rascal, else
we’d never have a penny. Oh, there’s always
plenty for me when I want it, but she
won’t spend it on herself. I can’t make her.
But I’ll get even with her some day, you see
if I don’t. I’ll plunge her into extravagance.
What’s that shutter slamming for?
I tell you I don’t like the way the wind is
rising. When I think of that girl and her
two babies——”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come over on our piazza
and sit awhile?” suggested the visitor; to
keep rolling over and over on a wheel of
marital sympathy embarrassed him.</p>

<p>“No, I thank you, I rather think I’ll turn
in early,” said Ranney, rising as the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
had done. Mr. Laurence hurried home to
his wife, childishly eager to startle her with
his piece of news. Ranney was going to bed
at nine-of-the-clock.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad he’s missed her for one
evening,” she retorted viciously. “It won’t
last, though.”</p>

<p>But the next night when she happened to
stroll over to the dividing fence in the half
gloom, she discerned a figure sitting on the
steps. He rose and came slowly forward, as
she spoke, removing the old felt basin from
his head perfunctorily.</p>

<p>“It looks very lonely over here without
Mrs. Ranney and the children,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, it does,” answered Mr. Ranney. He
knocked his pipe ruminatively on the top
rail. “I didn’t realize before what a helpless
being a man is without his wife; I never
can remember where she keeps the clean
towels.”</p>

<p>“I suppose she felt that she needed the
change,” suggested Mrs. Laurence, a little
stiffly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I persuaded her to go. She didn’t
want to leave me, but a girl has to see her
family sometimes; it’s only right.” He took
a long breath. “It’s only <em>right</em>. When the
letter came I said she ought to go, I said:
‘Jean, <em>I</em> can get along; your place this summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
is with your father and mother.’ She’s
only been home once since I took her away—her
family don’t like it very much. I had
a hard time to get the scamp—regular stern-chase;
but a man thinks a good bit more of
a girl when he has to work to get her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” responded Mrs. Laurence,
though she didn’t think so at all—she adored
the dear knowledge that she and Will had
loved within five minutes by the watch. And
to marry a woman and never care like this
until she was gone! The thought gave her
a shiver, as she confided later to her own
husband, with her hand in his. Suppose
Mr. Ranney’s appreciation of his little lonely
wife had come too late?</p>

<p>Hereafter, night after night, the wondering
Ridge beheld the deserted husband, disreputably
attired, sitting upon his piazza steps
or pacing up and down the narrow walk,
keeping guard like a faithful dog who has
been left to watch. Every evening, some
man, urged thereto by his wife, strolled over
to keep him company, though the rambling
conversation always harked back to Mrs.
Ranney through every masculine theme.
The street grew to feel a distinct proprietorship
that gave a sense of daily responsibility,
and it grew even stronger, when, as time
went on, he became gradually taciturn and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
moody, with a manner that said plainly that
he preferred his own company to that of any
friends, however well-meaning.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad Mrs. Ranney is coming
home next week,” said Mrs. Spicer feelingly,
as she and Mrs. Laurence stopped on a street
corner in the village for a heart-to-heart talk.
“I don’t know what would become of that
poor man if she stayed away much longer.
How much we will have to tell her!”</p>

<p>“Minda says he hardly eats a thing,” said
Mrs. Laurence.</p>

<p>“He ate a little of the pudding I sent over
last night. His devotion is really beautiful,
but I don’t quite like his state of mind, it
makes me anxious, and his appearance is
so——” Mrs. Spicer paused uncomfortably.
“I wish he’d shave! Ernest Spicer says he
hates to be seen in the street with him.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’ll be home soon,” said Mrs.
Laurence.</p>

<p>That was a fearsome night indeed, and one
long to be remembered, the night before Mrs.
Ranney was expected home. A wild September
gale sent the deluge of rain aslant
through the darkness, swirling it over lawns
and among the trees into a river-torrent that
carried all before it. It was a shrieking gale
that tore up the houses with maniac fingers,
wresting off shutters and chimney tops, dragging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
down trees in its giant fury, howling
and whining between the shrieks like a forest
of spectral wolves rushing ever faster and
faster upon their prey. The rain beat in
through window-casing and foundation, front
doors flew open wide at the hand of the tempest.
The steeple of the church came crashing
down; the orphan asylum was unroofed;
the affrighted fancy soared into realms of
terror with the far-clanging sound of the
fire-bell, caught and lost again amid the
clamour of the storm.</p>

<p>No one slept on the Ridge that night;
mothers sat by the bedside of their little children,
fathers patrolled the house to see that
timbers held, and the fire was kept low.
There was not a household near the Ranneys’
in which some member had not said awesomely
to another:</p>

<p>“And she is out on the ocean!” Imagination
pictured the husband (as indeed Minda
described him afterwards), walking up and
down, up and down, up and down, with savage,
miserable eyes, all night long, desperately
fighting with agonized thoughts.</p>

<p>But, with the first sullen rays of the morning
light he was gone. The tempest had
abated into a fog-filled, engulfing rain, that
washed all the landscape into a dirty yellow.
The street on the Ridge was flooded from end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to end, so that a canoe might paddle down
it; but the women who lived on the same
side of the way ventured with rain-coats and
overshoes into each others’ houses to compare
notes of the night, and to commune tearfully
on the news of the morning papers. It
was rumoured that the <em>Patriot</em> had foundered
with all on board. “That girl with her
two babies”—suppose she could never know.
All that day men and women stood in line by
the offices of the Nor-Coast Steamship Company,
waiting, waiting, waiting for the word
that meant life, or the losing of it. The “extras”
with scare-lines about the <em>Patriot</em>
with letters a foot long, were thrust before the
eyes, or called in the ears of that waiting
throng that thinned and fluctuated and filled
up again. The extras even reached the
Ridge. But at five o’clock Mr. Laurence
brought home word that the <em>Patriot’s</em> passengers
had been transferred from the sinking
steamer to the ship of another line, and were
expected in by seven.</p>

<p>It was something after ten when the travellers
arrived in one of the station cabs. The
dwellers in the different houses had been excitedly
on the lookout ever since dinner, congregating
in Mrs. Laurence’s drawing-room,
the women overflowing with excited sentiment,
and the men, excited too, discussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the different aspects of the disaster. Minda
had been overwhelmed with offers of help,
and numberless dishes sent over to her for
the refreshment of the wayfarers—jellies,
creamed chicken, biscuit and layer cake, and
many instructions given.</p>

<p>“Be sure and have the coffee just ready to
put on,” Mrs. Stone had directed, in the very
kitchen itself. “Mr. Ranney will feel the
need of it as well as Mrs. Ranney after all the
strain he has been through; and be sure and
keep the two kettles boiling. I have sent for
my rubber water-bags, as well as Mrs. Spicer’s,
so that in case of chill or collapse we may
have enough. One cannot tell what the
effect of all that terrible exposure may have
been. People have had their arms and legs
frozen off in a shipwreck,” said Mrs. Stone,
with a slight confusion as to the time of year.</p>

<p>The house was alight and welcoming as
the carriage, its lamps leering mistily through
the fog, lurched to a halt in the splashing
flood by the curb; half a dozen hands were
reached out to carry the sleeping children,
and the luggage, and help the travellers.</p>

<p>“Why, how kind of you all to be here!”
said Mrs. Ranney’s sweet, low voice, in gentle
surprise. She looked younger than one
remembered as they all crowded into the little
drawing-room; though her beautiful hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
was slightly dishevelled under her hat, and
her face was pale, her brow was as serene as
ever.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re <em>so</em> glad to have you back
again,” cried Mrs. Spicer, with hysterical inflection,
embracing the newcomer. “I don’t
know what Mr. Ranney would have <em>done</em> if
you’d stayed away another day!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no trouble about <em>me</em>,” disclaimed Mr.
Ranney loftily. He deposited a bundle of
shawls in the centre of the room as he spoke
and took them up again restlessly. “Where
do you want these put, Jean?—I told Mrs.
Ranney that I could have got along without
her just as well as not for another two weeks,
but she wanted to get home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought I’d better,” assented Mrs.
Ranney.</p>

<p>“You’ve been through so <em>much</em>,” said Mrs.
Laurence pitifully. Her hand and Mrs. Ranney’s
gripped, unseen. “To be in that storm
on that sinking ship, with those two babies—I
can’t begin to tell you how we’ve felt about
it; how anxious——” her voice broke.</p>

<p>“Now, now, now, a little blow like that
amounts to nothing,” said Mr. Ranney, with
irritating contemptuousness. He had the offensive
quarter-deck manner. “The passengers
were transferred from one steamer to
another simply for convenience in transportation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
There was not the slightest danger at
any time; nothing in the <em>world</em> to be excited
about!”</p>

<p>“No indeed,” corroborated Mrs. Ranney.
She followed the group of women who hovered
towards the kitchen a moment later, her
large, flower-blue eyes bent earnestly upon
them. “What is it you were just saying,
Mrs. Spicer? No, I don’t think you’d better
undress the children. I’ll just let them sleep
as they are, after slipping off their shoes;
they’re so tired. Mr. Ranney and Minda
will carry them up-stairs. Please, Mrs. Stone,
don’t get any coffee for us—it’s just as <em>kind</em>—I
appreciate all the trouble you’ve taken,
but we had dinner at the Astor House before
we came out; we couldn’t eat a thing now.
And would you mind not saying anything
more about the voyage? My husband
doesn’t like to talk about it. I think a good
night’s rest is what we all need.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s evident they’ve no more use for
<em>us</em>,” said Mrs. Stone with a sigh of acquiescence
as the sympathizers stood once more
without the portals; the position was felt to
be symbolic, yet after the first bewildered drop
from exaltation there was only a faint offense
left. Mrs. Stone voiced the general sentiment
as she continued:</p>

<p>“There’s one thing certain, Mr. Ranney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
will never forget these last six weeks; I don’t
care how he <em>talks</em>, he can’t keep his eyes off
her face. He has found out what his wife is,
at last.”</p>

<p>So deep was this feeling of certainty, that
almost an electric, shuddering wave of horror
passed over the Ridge the next evening when
Mr. Ranney, natty and immaculate, his gold-banded
yachting cap on the side of his head,
pipe in hand, swung jauntily out of his front
gate into the broad, white moonlight that lay
along the street. Only Mrs. Laurence, from
the contradictory evidence of her own deep
love, had a sudden, sweet, half-smile-and-tearful
divination, that he hadn’t had the heart
for freedom before, with his wife away. Her
dear presence now was so pervasive that the
whole town seemed like home to him because
she was in it.</p>

<h3>A Symphony in Coal</h3>

<p>“Did you order the coal for the furnace
yesterday?”</p>

<p>“No, by George! I forgot it.”
Mr. Laurence half paused, his tall figure
arrested in the act of putting on his overcoat
in the front hall, to which his wife had followed
him, napkin in hand, from the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>Will</em>! and I told you the day before,
so that you’d have plenty of time.” Mrs.
Laurence’s brows expressed tragic disappointment,
her tone, if affectionate, was despairing.
“I never saw any one like you,
you never remember a thing I ask you
to, any more. You don’t seem to have a
mind for anything but that old law business.
You’ll <em>have</em> to order the coal this morning.”</p>

<p>“But, Nan”—Mr. Laurence, with his overcoat
on and hat in hand, bent his fine, thin
face over his watch. “I don’t see how I
can, possibly; I’ve an appointment in town,
and I must go around by Herkimer Street
on my way to the station to see if Lalor’s got
the papers he promised me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought you were going there to-night.”
Mrs. Laurence held the door-knob
fast.</p>

<p>“I am, but I want the papers first.
Couldn’t you send one of the maids to
order the coal?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could, but I won’t,” said his wife.
Her dark eyes flashed, her tone had the conscious
defiance of the loved woman, who can
trade on her charm enough to be belligerent
if she feels like it. “It’s got to the place
where I see to every single article we eat or
wear or use in this house <em>but</em> the coal! And
I just won’t order that. I told you about it
three days ago and we <em>must</em> have it this
morning, with all this snow on the ground,
whether it makes you late for your appointment
or not.”</p>

<p>“Then let me go now,” said Mr. Laurence
tersely, putting aside the arms with which
she sought to encircle him as he swooped
hastily over to kiss her on his way out. The
open door let in a rush of cold air, as almost
visibly keen and sparkling as a scimitar, that
clove the lungs for a moment, before it
was closed behind him, and his wife went
back to the breakfast table where her ten-year-old
son awaited her to glean the information
about his history lesson which he
should have looked up for himself the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
before. It was, perhaps, the trouble with
Mrs. Laurence that her brightness and her
intelligence served to help only by taking
the whole burden of a thing upon herself; it
might be indeed the reason why Mr. Laurence’s
official duties in the household had
dwindled down to the ordering of coal, and
the minor courtesy of getting a glass of
water for her himself before she went to bed;
it might be because she had never been able
to see him do anything without doing it too.
In the days when he had ostensibly locked up
for the night she always followed around
after him to see that the windows and doors
were really bolted, so that gradually he left it
all to her; if he poked the fire she snatched
up the poker from where he had laid it to do
the work over again. If he were sitting
down she carried her own chair near the lamp
rather than draw his attention to her need.
Yet, sometimes, she had begun to have a little
hurt feeling that he let her do so much. As
to this matter of the coal—she could have
sent Teresa to Harner’s, of course—it was
before that revelling era of house-to-house
telephoning on the Ridge—yet even at the
thought she stiffened a little. There are
certain unnoticed beams and girders that
hold up an edifice; if one of these is out of
plumb the whole building sags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>If Will really refused to order the coal he
couldn’t be quite her Will any more.</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence, leaving the house, had debated
momently in which of two opposite
directions he should proceed, then he turned
up Herkimer Street; to get the papers from
Lalor was part of that “business” which, to
a man, comes first. The air did not mellow
after that initial plunge into it, it became almost
unbearably keen not only in the blue
shadows that lay along the freezing snow,
but even where the sunshine set it glittering.
Half of the walks were shovelled to make a
narrow, icy pathway, but where there were
unoccupied lots the drifts lay white and
high, broken only by the deep leg-prints of
commuters. As he strode swiftly on men
shot from several houses; a very fat man, a
tall one, a short one, their black figures
sprinting madly in line across the white expanse
towards the sound of a train slowing
into the station.</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence’s brows contracted unconsciously—he
ought to be on that train himself.
If it were not for getting that paper
from Lalor—the case was an important one,
a good deal of Mr. Laurence’s future depended
on it; he had taken it up rather
against the advice of his closest friends, they
thought it would be impossible to win it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
he had that little inner conviction, that intangible
sense of mastery that often spells
success. It gave him a nervous power that
on occasion seemed to have no end, but just
because it was a matter of highly strung
nerves a tiny obstruction jarred them out of
use; the tension was gone beyond immediate
recall—it might take hours or days even to
get the instrument back to that pitch—it
might never get there. It was sometimes
almost in the nature of self-preservation
when he shut himself off from the minor
pressure, the minor affairs. In this present
instance, as he strode along his mind was
bent on Lalor, whose former subordinate
connection with the incriminated corporation
seemed to have been forgotten by every one
but himself. Lalor was a shifty, uncertain
genius, not to be depended on, yet from
whom some central facts would have to be
wrested; the trouble was to keep hold of
him; he required constant bolstering up.</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Lalor!”</p>

<p>Laurence stopped short as he nearly
collided with a very slight woman, blown at
him at the turn of the corner by a sweeping
gale that devastated the sunshine. “Here,
turn around for a moment until that blast is
over.”</p>

<p>He steadied her where she stood panting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and breathless, looking down at the top of
her light-blue <em>chiffon</em> hat, which had rather a
pale and chilly early-morning effect in connection
with a tight-fitting tan jacket. In
lieu of furs she wore a white, pink-flowered
silk scarf tied around her throat, the long
fringed ends depending below her waist.
Her figure was that of a young girl, but
when she raised her small, long-chinned face
you saw that she was considerably older;
there were innumerable fine wrinkles around
her pretty eyes—which had a soft haze over
them, as if she had cried a great deal—and
her abundant fair hair seemed a shade or two
lighter than any nature could have intended
it. She had an indescribable effect of artificiality
counteracted rather appealingly by
something bright and courageous in her
gaze. Opinion halted about Mrs. Lalor,
who, as a Southern woman was not only
alien in habit to the Northern community to
which she had lately come, but was also
looked upon debatingly by the small society
of Southerners in the place, usually hospitably
ready to welcome any one from home.</p>

<p>It was unquestionable that she came of a
good family, which counted for very much,
but it was rumoured that she had married
against the family wishes. No one knew
anything of Mr. Lalor—who, in appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was a tall, handsome man with a drooping,
reddish-brown mustache—except that he
was unpleasingly dissipated and always in
difficulties; it seemed to discredit his wife in
some way that she lived with him. She had,
besides a little flirting, attractive manner to
men, a sort of an echo of past belleship, which
might have been all right if she had a nice
husband, but was felt to be a little stepping
over the line when she hadn’t. A few women
averred that there was something in her that
they really liked, of whom tender-hearted
little Mrs. Ramsey was one, and her neighbour,
Mrs. Laurence another. The latter was
by nature both generous and romantic, and
with an unselfish, intelligent insight into lives
that were different from her own.</p>

<p>There was a trustfulness in Mrs. Lalor’s
attitude now which appealed to Laurence.
He let go his hold of her as the wind subsided,
to say:</p>

<p>“What are you out so early for this bitter
morning? I’m just on my way to your house.
Is Lalor in?”</p>

<p>“If you were going for those papers”—Mrs.
Lalor began tugging at the breast of her
jacket for a visible package—“My husband
meant to bring them around last night, but
he’s in bed—with a cold.” Every one knew
what Mr. Lalor’s “colds” implied. “I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
you might need them to-day; I was so afraid
I wouldn’t catch you in time.” She drew a
sharp breath that showed how she had been
hurrying.</p>

<p>“It was awfully good of you,” said Mr.
Laurence warmly, as they turned down another
street together. “Lalor will be well
enough to be seen this evening, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sure he will,” said Mrs. Lalor,
in a tone that guaranteed it. “But I want to
ask you, Mr. Laurence”—her face became
suddenly fixed and expressionless—“in seeing
that you get the evidence you want,
my husband will not be—<em>prominent</em> in any
way?”</p>

<p>“His name need not appear at all,” said
Laurence promptly. His arm hovered spasmodically
near her as she went slipping and
lurching alternately beside him—“<em>Take</em> care!
You’d better not walk any farther.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have to go as far as Harner’s to
order a ton of furnace coal.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stop and order it for you, if that’s
all,” said Mr. Laurence. His eyes, lightly
comprehensive, took note of the clock in the
church tower. “I’ve got a good five minutes
before my train. You go straight home,
Mrs. Lalor.”</p>

<p>He looked down protectingly to meet her
upward gaze, which was relieved and coquettish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and yet, somehow, a little sad, as
she answered:</p>

<p>“Well, if you will——! I never do anything
for myself if there’s a gentleman to do
it for me.”</p>

<p>He raised his hat before starting on, and
when he looked back she waved her hand to
him. The large advancing figure of Mrs.
Stone—on her way home from wresting the
early chop from the butcher—amply furred
and heavily goloshed, her beaver hat as well
as her face swathed in a thick, brown veil,
threw into high relief the tawdry lightness of
Mrs. Lalor’s attire.</p>

<p>He recollected that if he ever objected to a
thin jacket on his wife she invariably professed
to be “warm underneath.” Mrs. Lalor
might also be warm underneath, but he had
a masculine preference for having people <em>look</em>
warm in winter-time.</p>

<p>Poor little woman! He shook his head as
he thought of Lalor, with a quick compression
of his lips. Then a long whistle from up
the track sent him tearing ahead in the teeth
of the wind, to thrust his head at last inside
of Harner’s office and call out:</p>

<p>“Send a ton of furnace coal to Mrs. Lalor,
36 Herkimer Street, and be quick about it,”
before settling down into that swift run back
that carried him swinging up by the guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
rail onto the slippery steps of the last car, and
out into that region where women and household
matters are not.</p>

<p>The first thing Mrs. Laurence said when
she came in at lunch time, after a morning
spent abroad, was:</p>

<p>“How freezing cold this house is! Hasn’t
the coal come yet, Teresa?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“How provoking!” Mrs. Laurence stopped
short in disgust. “I never saw such a place;
it’s as much as your life’s worth to get anything
delivered when you want it. Is that
Timothy I hear in the cellar now?” Timothy
was the furnace man of the Ridge. “Tell
him not to let the fire go entirely out; we’ll
have to manage it some way. If he comes
back between two and three the coal will certainly
be here then.”</p>

<p>But two o’clock, three o’clock, four o’clock
passed, and no coal wagon backed up to the
sidewalk in front, of the Laurences, though a
succession of them passed funereally through
the white street, <em>en route</em> for more fortunate
householders. At a quarter after four she
gave a joyful exclamation—one had stopped,
at last, opposite her door; but the joy was
short-lived—the wagon honked further along,
tentatively, until it stopped at Mrs. Spicer’s
half-way down the block.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In a minute more Mrs. Laurence could see
the dark legs of alternate men outlined against
the drifts, as they carried buckets of the precious
fuel to the opening in the cellar at the
side of the Spicer villa. Something seemed
to shatter through her—an iconoclastic blast,
that she had been striving to shut out. Could
Will have possibly forgotten between the house
and the station? But no, that could not be!</p>

<p>She dressed hastily, in the later stages of
her toilet vibrating between the silver-decked
dressing-table, and the window, from behind
the curtains of which she took recurrent peeps.
At her last look she ran hastily down the stairs
and opened the front door for Mrs. Stone, who
was temporarily garbed in a polo cap and her
husband’s spring overcoat, into the pockets
of which she had thrust her hands.</p>

<p>“I saw you coming along! It’s too cold
to be kept waiting on anybody’s door-step.
Walk right in, tea will be ready in a moment.”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d be sure to find you in now,”
said Mrs. Stone comfortably, shedding her
masculine apparel in the hall on her way to
the drawing-room where she established herself
with the ease of custom in a Turkish
chair by the gas logs. The Ridge was apt
to assemble informally at Mrs. Laurence’s for
five o’clock tea; it was known that she really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
had it whether there was any one there or
not; there was always something pleasantly
cosy about the little function.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone watched her hostess lazily as
she drew the low, china-laden table nearer
the fire, and lighted the lamp under the brass
kettle just brought in, her dark, graceful
head bent over to watch it, and her hands
showing very white against the dull red of
her gown.</p>

<p>“It’s such a relief to get in here,” said the
visitor, breaking the silence as she took the
steaming cup of fragrant tea offered her, and
helped herself to a tiny hot buttered scone,
from a blue Canton dish. “They are getting
in coal at the Budds’ this morning, and now
they’re at it at the Spicers’—the noise nearly
sets me crazy, the houses are so near together.
O Mrs. Spicer, I didn’t hear you come in!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone looked up with a start to see
another visitor walking, unannounced, into
the room, a little woman in a long fur wrap
with a lace scarf thrown over her head. “I
was just saying—perhaps you heard me—what
a noise your coal makes when it’s being
put in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t speak of it!” said Mrs. Spicer.
She seemed to greet her hostess, shed her
outer garments, perch herself on a little,
straight-backed sofa, and take her cup of tea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
at one and the same moment with a swiftness
of movement accelerated in her further
speech, which tumbled forth like a small cataract.
“Don’t speak of it, no one knows what
I went through last summer, when you were
at the seashore and <em>your</em> coal was laid in. I
couldn’t sit on the piazza <em>at all</em>, and the thermometer
was in the nineties. At the end of
the third day I nearly had nervous prostration.
Ernest Spicer was really worried about
me. <em>I</em> never find it any economy to lay in a
stock of coal; you use it up so much faster;
it seems as if you were paying out for enough
to last you until you died, and then, just at
the time you didn’t count on taking the
money for it you have to buy more. If we
laid in a <em>mine</em> full in July we’d have to order
coal in February.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish I were laying it in now,” interposed
Mrs. Laurence deftly, with a sigh.
“Mr. Laurence ordered some this morning,
and it hasn’t come yet. I would have sent a
message to Harner’s, but I have been expecting
the coal wagon every moment.”</p>

<p>“I saw your husband speaking to Mrs.
Lalor as I came back from the butcher’s,”
said Mrs. Stone. She paused significantly.
“Isn’t she the most noticeable thing you
ever saw! She never seems to have any
morning clothes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe she has any money for
new ones,” suggested Mrs. Laurence gently.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose she <em>has</em>, but even
then—— Of course, I’m sorry for her, we
all are; every one knows what Mr. Lalor is, but
do you know, the other day when I attempted
to allude to all that she must have to bear up
under—I felt so sympathetic towards her,
after what the Bents told us—she stiffened
up at once; she acted as if she hadn’t the
slightest idea of what I was driving at.
Now <em>that’s</em> absurd. To hear Mrs. Lalor talk
about ‘Bennie’ you’d think he was the king-pin,
as Mr. Stone expresses it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I think that’s really fine of her,”
said Mrs. Laurence, with proselyting zeal.
“There’s a courage, a devotion about her
that always appeals to me; you can’t help
seeing that she’s had such a hard time.
I’m sure if you knew her better you’d like
her.”</p>

<p>“She may be devoted to her husband,”
said Mrs. Spicer very fast, “but if you’d see
her going in on the train—Ernest Spicer says
he always avoids her when he <em>can</em>; he does
hate to be made conspicuous. I don’t care
whether she comes of a good family or not;
<em>I</em> think she’s common.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurence shook her head wisely.
“I’m sure that you’re mistaken, not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
I’m so well acquainted with her myself, but
still——”</p>

<p>She took occasion later on to detain Mrs.
Stone whisperingly a moment by the front
door as both visitors were making their exit.</p>

<p>“I thought I wouldn’t say it before <em>her</em>—but
why don’t you and Mr. Stone make a
call at the Lalors to-night? Will has a little
business with Mr. Lalor, and I’ll go with him.
<em>Do</em> come.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see,” temporized Mrs. Stone
with a softening inflection.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone was, as her hostess well knew,
the kind of a person who, after disapproving
publicly of a neighbour, privately sends her
pickles. She hastened down the steps now
to join her friend, her large, mannish figure
in the overcoat and cap wobbling ludicrously
on the narrow, slippery length of drift-bordered
sidewalk under the gas-lamps that
were already lighted.</p>

<p>The wind had gone down, but so had the
mercury; the air was “bitter chill.” As Mrs.
Laurence turned back into her hall the atmosphere
there seemed only a few degrees
warmer. Gas logs made but slight impression
on the general temperature of a house
in this weather; the hand that she held over
the register received but the faintest, scarce-warm
breath upon it. Mrs. Laurence still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
looked for a belated rattling coal-wagon, but
the hour seemed long until her husband’s
return; her heart bounded romantically at
the sound of his footsteps now, just as it had
done when she was a girl. His face was
ruefully smiling as he said after the kiss of
greeting:</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you’ve missed—all
my fault, too! I bought you a two-dollar
bunch of violets—— <em>Now wait</em> till I get
through—and left them in the train.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>Will</em>!” His wife’s brows drooped
tragically. “That’s so like you! You’re getting
too absent-minded to live. My lovely
violets!” she mourned tenderly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t the house very cold to-night?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should <em>think</em> it might be! It’s
freezing.” Mrs. Laurence’s accumulated
wrath poured forth. “There hasn’t been a
sign of the coal you ordered this morning,
and I’ve been waiting for it all day. It’s a
perfect outrage, and I want you to tell
Harner so, Will. You <em>did</em> order it, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Why, ye——” An extraordinary expression
stole over Mr. Laurence’s thin face, it was
as if his consciousness had been suddenly
arrested in mid-air. Well as his wife knew
his expressions and what they covered, this
surprisingly baffled her. He drummed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
his finger-tips on the edge of the dressing-table
before relaxing enough to say guardedly,
after a moment:</p>

<p>“By George! I don’t believe I did. I
knew there was <em>something</em>—I’m awfully
sorry, Anna, indeed I am.”</p>

<p>“<em>You didn’t order it!</em>—Will, please don’t
drum on things that way, you know it drives
me wild. Well, if you can’t remember one
thing I ask you to do—if you can’t keep a
single promise that you make me—— It
isn’t the <em>coal</em> I care about—though my feet have
been like stones all day—but it’s the fact that
I can’t depend on you for <em>anything</em>. <em>Please</em>
don’t whistle. You can attend to business
matters well enough, but when it comes to
the comfort of your wife and child——” an
unforeseen sob broke across the words. “Of
course, it’s been warm enough in your
steam-heated office to-day. I’m glad it
has been, I wouldn’t have had you cold for
anything.” In spite of her tears she was
following after him as he searched in his
chiffonier drawer for a clean collar. “You’ve
done it all so many times! You carried that
important letter to Hetty in your pocket for
six weeks before you told me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if you’re going on like this
every time I tell you anything, I’ll stop it,”
said Mr. Laurence doggedly. “You don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
give me any credit for owning up, Nan. You
wouldn’t know half the time when I make
mistakes, if I didn’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what else you could have said
when I asked you if you had ordered the coal.”</p>

<p>“I could have lied about it, I suppose,”
said Mr. Laurence impatiently.</p>

<p>“O Will!” she gasped with horror. Her
white chin went up, her dark eyes looked at
him full of agitation. She put her hands on
his shoulders and shook him ineffectively.
“You wouldn’t—you <em>couldn’t</em> do that! You
always tell me the truth, don’t you—all
of it?”</p>

<p>“Usually,” assented her husband. He had
finished settling his tie and now put his arms
around her. “But if it’s going to make you
any happier if I <em>don’t</em>——”</p>

<p>“No, no, no! You know I never could
mean that—never! I could forgive you anything
as long as you told me the truth.”</p>

<p>She clung to him as they went down to
dinner together, and she forbore to allude to
the state of the atmosphere, except by shivering
once or twice—the gas logs sent forth a
chill, blue flare. There was an odd return
to that arrested, baffling expression on
Mr. Laurence’s face, however, when his wife
announced her intention of going around to
the Lalors’ with him afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you think it is too cold for you to
go out to-night?” he asked, and she answered
with a playful gleam of the sarcasm
she couldn’t keep from using. “No, I think
it’s too cold for me to stay in.”</p>

<p>It was a matter for ejaculating surprise on
arriving at the Lalors’ to find the unexpected
Spicers instead of the Stones, who, however,
appeared in a few minutes. Mr. Spicer had a
slender, correct elegance of aspect, while Mr.
Stone was large, grayish, and rather portly.
Beside the Spicers, a Mrs. Frere and her
son, a dumb, immature youth, were already
in possession of the field. Mrs. Frere’s position
as a church worker carried her into connection
with people whom she might not
otherwise have met; the chief effect that she
produced on every one now was an ardent
desire that she should go. She sat in utter
silence with folded hands, but her dumbness
differed from that of her son in a patently
avid appreciation of everything that was said
or done.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lalor, in a low-throated, faded light
green gown covered with beautiful old lace,
was loud in expression of her surprise and
delight at this haphazard gathering. Mr.
Lalor, tall, handsome and with wandering
dissipated eyes and the same droop alike to
his reddish mustache and to his figure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
came forward also with hospitable welcome,
while his wife volubly ordered not only him
but the other men in behalf of her guests:</p>

<p>“Bennie, get that armchair out of the
corner for Mrs. Laurence; be careful the top
doesn’t fall off of it—we break all our
things moving so often! Mr. Stone, won’t
you put that footstool under Mrs. Spicer’s
feet, I’m sure she’s not comfortable. Mr.
Spicer, if you’ll kindly move the table near
me to make more room—Bennie, run up-stairs
and get the little feather hand-screen
for Mrs. Stone—I know that lamp’s shining
in your eyes.” She pronounced it “Shinin’
in yo’ eyes,” with a caressing, indolent
inflection to her soft voice. “It’s not the
least trouble for him, Mrs. Stone—Bennie always
waits on me.”</p>

<p>There was a seductive air of luxury about
Mrs. Lalor in spite of the fact that the cheap,
shabby upholstered chairs and sofa were profusely
covered with cheaper “drapings” on
such portions as were most subject to wear,
and that the mantelpiece, also draped, was
simply decorated with a single pink-mouthed
grinning conch shell—yet the latter was indeed
under an old, old painting of a low-browed
woman whose white throat and
rounded cheek gleamed out from rich brown
shadows—a woman who, even thus dimly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
seen, seemed to match the lace on Mrs. Lalor’s
gown.</p>

<p>“I only came because I thought you’d like
me to,” whispered Mrs. Spicer to Mrs. Laurence
in a pause of the later conversation.
Mrs. Stone gave an affectionate little squeeze
to her neighbour’s hand. “I thought Ernest
would object, but he seemed quite willing. I
wish that Mrs. Frere wasn’t here, you have
to be so careful what you say before her.”</p>

<p>“We won’t stay very long,” murmured
Mrs. Laurence assentingly. Mr. Lalor and
her husband had apologetically disappeared
behind closed doors to transact their business
together, the latter with that last look at her
over the heads of the others that meant their
own special farewell. Mrs. Lalor had insisted
on supplying every one with hot lemonade,
on account of the coldness of the weather,
calling the three men back and forth in her
services and holding a little couet with them
afterwards as she sat reclined in a rocking-chair.</p>

<p>“I reckon Mr. Eddie was right bored with
only me to talk to before you all came in,”
she announced with a smile directed at young
Mr. Frere. “You don’t know how glad I am
to see you gentlemen here. I enjoy gentlemen’s
society so much. Of course, I’ve always
had it till I came up No’th, and I miss it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
much. I wish you could have seen our po’ch
at home in the old times on a Sunday evenin’,
with my sister Mollie’s friends, and Emma
Lily’s, and mine, all lined up waiting for us
to come down.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Mrs. Stone.</p>

<p>“I told Bennie when I married him I never
could settle down to just one.” Mrs. Lalor
paused lightly. “I was engaged to six before
that. But he always said—‘George’
my name is George—‘I want you should enjoy
gentleman’s society just the same as you
always did.’ I was engaged first when I
was fourteen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>Southern</em> engagements!” said Mrs.
Laurence indulgently, with a gesture that disclaimed
their seriousness of intent to Mrs.
Stone’s startled gaze. There seemed to be
an unforeseen electrical quality in the air;
she had felt it even when she first came in,
but every lightest speech was oddly charged
with it, you couldn’t tell what was coming.
Instead of vindicating her confidence in Mrs.
Lalor, the latter seemed bent on a self destruction
that might drag any one else down with
her. She went on now happily.</p>

<p>“Of course, though I always cared most
for Bennie—he was such a beautiful waltzer.
Sometimes even now, after breakfast, if I’m a
little blue, he says, ‘Come, George, let’s have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a waltz,’ and he just spins me around the
room while he whistles the tune. I don’t
think there’s anything like dancing for keeping
up the spirits. I don’t know what I’d do
without Bennie up No’th here, he’s so thoughtful
of me!”</p>

<p>“How extraordinary!” breathed little Mrs.
Spicer to Mrs. Stone, athwart the rapt gaze
of the silent Mrs. Frere. It was evident that
neither Mr. Stone nor Mr. Spicer felt appalled,
both men seemed to be impalpably walled
off from the jurisdiction of their wives, as
they sat smiling with interested indulgence at
their hostess, with young Mr. Frere, open-mouthed,
behind them.</p>

<p>In spite of the semi-artificiality of her aspect,
Mrs. Lalor had an undoubted charm;
her face looked younger and less drawn by
lamplight, and her pretty, tear-soft eyes had
their coquettish gleam in them, her careless
attitude was full of lazy grace. She thrust
out a slippered foot with its hanging length
of ribbon, and gave an appealing glance at
the man nearest her.</p>

<p>“I know you want to tie my shoe for me,
Mr. Stone—no, Mr. Spicer, I didn’t say you.”</p>

<p>She laughed gleefully as they both jumped
for position, Mr. Stone’s large bulk going
down heavily on one knee with exaggerated
gallantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me fan you while he’s doing it,” cried
Mr. Spicer eagerly, seizing the required implement
from the table.</p>

<p>“You’d better fan Mrs. Stone, she looks so
warm,” suggested Mrs. Lalor. “The house
is so heated, it makes one’s face burn after
the cold air. Wouldn’t you like a little powder
to cool it?” She jumped up hospitably,
leaving Mr. Stone still upon the floor. “It
isn’t the slightest trouble to get it, I always
keep it in this little cupboard, with a puff and
a handglass—and some rouge,” she explained
in a confidential tone. “Not that I care for
rouge myself, Bennie doesn’t like it, but some
people always use it for the evenin’.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone gasped.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I need nothing of the kind,”
she said hastily. She, the mother of four, a
member of the Guild and the Vittoria Colonna
Club to be spoken to in connection with
<em>rouge</em>! Even Mrs. Laurence’s white chin
went up—this did seem “common.”</p>

<p>“And I really think we’ll have to be going,”
added Mrs. Stone with decision, rising as she
spoke, a signal imitated by Mrs. Spicer,
though Mrs. Frere sat fast.</p>

<p>“Oh, do wait for us,” pleaded Mrs. Laurence
eagerly. “Here is my husband now.
You’re ready to go now, aren’t you, Will?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as soon as I wrap up those documents,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
he assented, with an unconscious exhilaration
of tone that caught her ear. He
disappeared into the opposite room once
more. Mr. Lalor had just walked out of it,
and down the length of the bare hall, with
echoing steps.</p>

<p>“Oh, you <em>must</em> stay and have some more
hot lemonade,” Mrs. Lalor begged warmly,
and stopped suddenly short; a faint colour
came into her cheek; it was as if she listened,
not to the chorus, “No, not to-night——”
“Thank you just the same——” “We really
must go——” but to something impalpable,
unguessed.</p>

<p>“Excuse me for just one moment,” she
said and vanished swiftly into the narrow
passage, leaving behind her a surprised, disapproving
silence—even Mrs. Frere stood up;
there was a queer, unexpected sensation that
something was happening. Mrs. Laurence
went out nervously to get her cloak. In that
oblique glimpse down the hall to the dining-room
she saw—or didn’t she really see anything?—a
man’s arm stretched wildly out as
if to reach something—a woman’s hand
grasping it—the wavering shadow as of a
struggle—and the faintest sound as of a key
turning as it might be in a sideboard lock.
Something must be happening——! Though
only, indeed, one unimportant scene of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
tragedy such as these happy, protected
women had no knowledge of, that long, exquisitely
heart-racking, unmentionable strain
of living that companies the degradation of
one who is loved.</p>

<p>“Did your coal come to-day, Mrs. Laurence?”
asked Mrs. Stone in a chill, unnatural
voice. They were all getting on their
wraps now.</p>

<p>“No, it didn’t,” answered Mrs. Laurence.
Justice compelled her to add, with an effort:
“It wasn’t Harner’s fault, after all. Will forgot
to order it on his way to the station; he
felt so badly about it, but he’s had so
much business on his mind lately that I
really think I mustn’t ask him to do anything
more.”</p>

<p>“You’re more lenient than my wife would
have been,” said Mr. Stone jovially. “I’d
have gotten it in the neck.”</p>

<p>“You’d have deserved it,” agreed Mr.
Spicer.</p>

<p>“I feel dreadfully because you’re all going
so soon,” said Mrs. Lalor appearing once
more, clinging with both little hands to the
arm of her husband, who, sullen and dejected,
towered above her. She looked wan and
thin, as if some ageing mist had settled over
her, but the wrinkles that had deepened
around her pretty eyes did not keep them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
from being indomitably flirtatious as she
glanced back to the man who had followed
them in.</p>

<p>“Mr. Laurence and I haven’t had a
chance to tell any secrets <em>at all</em>!—What did
you say, Mrs. Spicer? Yes, the house <em>is</em>
warm, thanks to Mr. Laurence,” she assented
gayly. “He insisted on orderin’ my coal for
me this mornin’.”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. To her dying
day Mrs. Laurence could see that whole
scene definitely before her—the embarrassed
attitudes of the men; the arrested, guilty
expression on her husband’s face that all
might read; Mrs. Frere’s greedy joy; the
compassionate gaze of Mrs. Stone and Mrs.
Spicer after their swift flash of comprehension.—Yet
after that one paralyzing moment
she rose staunchly superior to the
petty, yet excruciating entanglement of the
situation. She stepped forward and kissed
Mrs. Lalor good-bye in the face of her little
world, with a hand-pressure that emphasized
the words:</p>

<p>“I’m so glad Mr. Laurence could be of
service to you,” before she made her exit
with him. Yet there were those who felt
that they were not deceived and the eyes of
Mr. Stone and Mr. Spicer met as the door
closed behind the husband and wife—and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
was a glance that confided a sinister and
mutual thankfulness of escape.</p>

<p>The two in question walked swiftly away
in silence on the starlit, drift-bordered path;
the wind had gone down but it was infinitely
cold. They went, part of the time, in single
file, but she ignored his tentative pressure on
her arm; there seemed to be an icy chasm
between them. The distance to the house
was short, and it was not until they were inside
it that she broke forth hotly, as if they
had been talking together all the way, her
crimson cheeks and blazing eyes facing his
tall, reluctant figure as she threw off her
wraps.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t as if I could <em>ever</em> say anything
to those people to explain! Oh, it’s so perfectly
horrid, so <em>maddening</em>, so utterly ridiculous
on the face of it!—They’ll think I’m
jealous of her—they’ll be sorry for me.
<em>Sorry!</em> As if I could possibly be jealous of
<em>her</em>. They’ll think you keep everything from
me, and that they know more about you than
I do. How could you have put me in such
a position when just a word——” She made
a little sound that was half a moan. “Why
you didn’t have the decency to tell me before
we went there I <em>can’t</em> see.” Her voice rose
higher. “Yes I can—you were afraid;
afraid of your wife! It does seem pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
bad to have you remember to do things for
other people, when you can’t remember
them for me, but that isn’t the point I mind
most, it’s not the real thing—what I <em>can’t</em>
stand is you not having the courage to own
up, to tell me the truth. Why don’t you say
something?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re saying it all.”</p>

<p>“O Will!” She gazed at him hopelessly
as he stood in front of her, her hand laid detainingly
on his arm. He looked very high-bred,
very much a gentleman, with that air
of aloof <em>hauteur</em>; there were circles under his
dark eyes, and his lips had a compression
that she well knew. If there was anything
that Mr. Laurence hated temperamentally it
was a shrewish woman; the ice of the
winter’s night couldn’t freeze harder than he
when she stormed, even though he allowed
that she had righteous reason for her wrath.
He spoke now, in answer to her appeal, with
stiff, prideful humility:</p>

<p>“You know very well that I’m extremely
sorry about the whole matter. As for ordering
that coal for Mrs. Lalor, I meant to have
told you about it when we got back, you
know I never can keep anything from you;
I don’t <em>want</em> to. I forgot it when I first
came home—and then you took me by surprise,
someway. And now don’t you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
we’ve perhaps had enough of this? <em>I’m</em>
tired.”</p>

<p>“No, no; don’t go yet!” Mrs. Laurence’s
hand pinioned him fast. She had known all
along that she would forgive him when she
had spoken her mind—what else can one do
but forgive when one loves? Oh, that was
but a little part of it—the forgiveness! The
real need all the time was that he should be
reinstated on the pedestal from which his
own act had driven him. He must be, not
the Will whom she forgave, but the
Will whom she adored. Her certainty
dropped from her; she began reasonably,
to grow more and more tremulously beseeching.</p>

<p>“Will, <em>please</em> listen! I can’t bear it when
you look at me as if you didn’t like me. Of
course, I knew all the time that you were
sorry—I knew you meant to tell me the
truth! <em>Of course</em>, you can’t always think of
it at the moment when I take you by surprise
and fly at you and scold you—nobody
could! I don’t wonder that you hate to tell
me things, when I make it so hard for you.
I ought to be a hundred times nicer than I
am. When I saw <em>her</em> husband standing there
to-night you looked so fine and beautiful and
good—and <em>truthful</em>”—a sob, not tears, but
just a sob broke athwart the words—“I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
thank God every day on my <em>knees</em> that I’m
married to you!”</p>

<p>Her arms dropped from their hold, but his
were around her now, pressing her closer,
and still closer; the eyes he bent upon the
upturned face were smiling, yet a little
moist, too—his tender voice had in it every
admission that she longed for as he whispered:</p>

<p>“Oh, Nan—foolish, foolish Nan! Such a
<em>sweet</em> woman——!”</p>

<h3>The Triumph of Father</h3>

<p>“Well, what do you want me to do
to-day, Min? Speak up quick.”
Mr. Harlow, in his holiday morning
costume, consisting of a pair of old and
baggy trousers, an outing shirt and an utterly
incongruous coat, with bulging pockets,
stood by the piazza steps, a disreputable grey
felt hat held in one hand.</p>

<p>“It’s nearly ten o’clock, and I must go
down-town and get some nails before the
stores close for the day. I had expected to
send one of the boys, but Betty tells me that
Herbert has gone to play in the golf tournament,
and Jack is off to the ball game. If
there’s anything round the house you want
mended, now’s your time to tell me.”</p>

<p>“We want a screw for the wringer—or
perhaps it’s a nut,” said Mrs. Harlow, hazily,
her eyes fixed on her husband. “The top is
off the piano-stool again, and there is the
arm of the red chair,—you’ll find it in the
closet under the stairs,—and one of the
faucets in the kitchen sink will keep running.
Oh, yes, and there’s a caster broken off the
refrigerator, too; we have to prop it up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
a block of wood, but it’s so crooked that the
water from it goes all over the cellar floor.
Please don’t forget it, will you? But, David,
you are not going down to the village looking
like that? It’s really disgraceful! If
any one should see you! It won’t take you
a minute to go up-stairs and change your
coat and put on another necktie.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the clothes I have
on?” Mr. Harlow looked down at himself
with satisfaction. “Just the things to work
in, good and easy. I’ll go on now, and you
can think what else you want done, and tell
me when I come back.” He stopped to take
the letters from the grey-clad postman, who
had just come up with the one mail of a holiday.
“Here’s one for me from Tom. I’ll
read it as I go along. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>Mr. Harlow, who had put on his hat, took
it off in courtesy to his wife, as he looked
back and smiled a last affectionate farewell to
her from the other side of the gate. Her
eyes watched his large form, with its firm
stride, until it disappeared round the corner.
She loved his little politenesses of manner to
her.</p>

<p>The wind touched the purple clusters of
wistaria above her head, and shook out a
sweet perfume from them. The grass around
the house was close cut and velvety, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
next door the lawn-mower was click-clicking
busily, and the sky was as blue as a summer
sky.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harlow, slender and trim in a freshly
washed lilac cambric gown that matched the
wistaria, sat on the piazza opening her letters
with the true holiday feeling of the suburbanite.</p>

<p>Nothing whatever of interest presented itself
for her amusement, but the mere fact that
her husband was at home for the day seemed
to breathe a pleasant sense of confusion and
excitement that disqualified her for any connected
occupation, in spite of the big pile of
sewing up-stairs.</p>

<p>“Any letters, mother?”</p>

<p>Betty, the daughter of the house, who had
come out in a white shirt-waist and a straw
hat decked with last year’s blue corn-flowers,
perched herself on the end of the piazza.
“I’m going to the train to meet Sylvia, but
it isn’t time yet. I’m so glad she’ll be here!
I haven’t seen her for weeks.”</p>

<p>“There’s a letter from your Aunt Kitty,”
said the mother. “She says your Uncle Tom
is going to retire from business. They want
to take Lutie abroad for change of air. She
must be nearly eight years old now. She’s
been so well lately they’re afraid of a reaction.
I can’t quite make out where they’re going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
first; it looks like Himalaya. Oh, I see! It’s
Edinburgh.”</p>

<p>“It might as well be Himalaya. Lutie’s
never had anything but changes of air since
she was born,” said Betty, crossly. “How
some people do travel! They seem to have
money for everything, while we—well, things
can’t go on like this much longer! I’m going
to work and earn something just as soon as
I can now. And Jack says he wants to leave
school and go in an office like Herbert. It’s
too bad to leave so much on father. Don’t
you think he has had more on his mind
lately?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he has,” said Mrs. Harlow, with
a sigh. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Oh, something so horrid happened yesterday!
I meant to keep it to myself, but I
can’t.” Betty’s cheeks were red, her eyes
were flashing. “I was at Mrs. Kennedy’s,
with those books, and she asked if there was
anything the matter with father, he had been
looking so worn lately. She thought outsiders
always noticed those things more
quickly than the family.”</p>

<p>“The idea!” said Mrs. Harlow, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Then when I was in the hall I heard them
talking; I couldn’t help it. They said—she
and Mrs. Bradley—what a pity it was when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
man didn’t get on well in business, and Mrs.
Tower said she was always so sorry for the
wife of an unsuccessful man; it must be so
dreadful, if you had any ambition, to see your
husband a failure. She said she never could
really respect a man who showed himself
deficient. I was so angry I could hardly
walk home. I went up-stairs and cried. I
wanted to burst right in and tell them how
nobly father had behaved when that old Johnson
absconded, and how he was trying to pay
up all the back debts. But I knew it wasn’t
any use——”</p>

<p>“Deficient!” Mrs. Harlow’s eyes glittered.
“Your father’s brain—well, your
father’s brain is far beyond most people’s.
How he can make all those calculations the
way he does——” She paused. Her own
education dated back of the modern era. She
was sound on the arithmetic of her butcher’s
and grocer’s books, but beyond that all figures
looked to her much like a drop of water seen
through a microscope.</p>

<p>“There’s the whistle!” said Betty, suddenly
jumping up and making for the train to meet
her best friend.</p>

<p>The subject of this conversation had meanwhile
been wending his way to the town. He
perhaps had looked forward to a time of
pecuniary ease and leisure, when, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
tinkering round the house, he might play golf.
But no one, not even his wife, quite understood
what a holiday meant to Mr. Harlow.</p>

<p>To escape for a solid block of sunlit secular
hours out of the grimy, artificially lighted,
badly ventilated office, with its white, tired-looking
clerks, and its association of intricate,
harassing toil—to escape from this to the
peacefulness of green grass, and the click of
the lawn-mower, and the flickering of shade
from the new leaves of the elms that arched
the street, and the sweet voices of little
children calling to one another, was to go
back into a little corner of the emerald fields
of boyhood.</p>

<p>Mr. Harlow was not in the least old; he
was indeed barely middle-aged; yet there
were moments when he knew that he was
not so young as he had been. On the spring
morning of a holiday the thought, even if it
came, was robbed of its shadow.</p>

<p>His face had the kind smile that children
always trusted, as he stopped to pick up a
tiny, curly-haired girl who had fallen in his
way. The action showed him the letter,
which he had forgotten, still in his hand.</p>

<p>He opened and read it as he walked,
stopped short and read it again with knitted
brows. Then he walked on and on, as one
deep in thought, until he came to the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
side of the village. He did not go near the
stores, but strolled instead towards a large,
unoccupied house that stood surrounded by
lawns and trees, well apart from its neighbours.
There was a clear view of the hills
from the porch. Mr. Harlow walked round
the house and through the garden, and sat
on the porch steps, still deep in thought.</p>

<p>“I did not know what had become of
you,” said his wife, running down the walk
to meet him as he once more came in through
the gate. “Why, it’s after twelve o’clock!
I was afraid something had happened to
you! I suppose you’ve been talking all this
time to somebody.” She did not give him
an opportunity to answer, but drew him up
beside her to one of the piazza chairs. “I
know you won’t have time to mend all those
things I asked you to, without taking up all
your afternoon, and I don’t want you to do
that. But I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to
fix the leg of the refrigerator.”</p>

<p>“It would be better to buy a new one,
wouldn’t it?” asked Mr. Harlow, impartially.</p>

<p>“‘Better to buy a new one!’ I only wish
I could. How queer you act, David! Aren’t
you going to put the netting on the screens
now? I think you’ll have time before dinner;
it’s to be at one o’clock to-day.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do the screens now, Min. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
store was shut when I went to buy the nails.
Who’s that talking to Betty?”</p>

<p>“It’s Sylvia; she has come out for a couple
of days. And, O David, a telegram came
for Betty while you were gone, from Harry
Leroy. He’ll be on to-night, and he’s not
going back to Indiana any more. He has a
position here with his cousin.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” Mr. Harlow looked doubtfully
considerate. “How old is Betty? Fifteen?”</p>

<p>“She will be nineteen in September.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, she’s nothing but a child yet,”
said Mr. Harlow, in a tone that defied denial.</p>

<p>“Nothing but a child,” assented his wife,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>There was a pause. “How old were you
when we were married, Min?”</p>

<p>“Twenty. It was entirely too young.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” Mr. Harlow’s voice was reflective,
“my mother told me she was
married at seventeen and my grandmother
was married at fifteen; and I had an aunt
who——”</p>

<p>“If you remember any more I’ll go in the
house!” said his wife, indignantly. “What
is the matter with you, David? Where have
you been this morning?”</p>

<p>“Well, Min, I’ve something to tell you.
I——” he stopped, his voice altered and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
eyes became suddenly alert. “Hello! What’s
that over there?”</p>

<p>“Smoke, isn’t it?” she answered, her gaze
following his towards the horizon. “It seems
to me I can smell it.”</p>

<p>“Looks like a fire, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t hear any fire-bells.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harlow rose. “Two-thirds of our beloved
volunteer fire department are off on a
picnic or a procession or something to-day.
I’m going over to that smoke on the old
bicycle, and find out what’s the matter.”</p>

<p>“You’d a great deal better stay at home!”
his wife called after him, but he was gone.</p>

<p>She still sat on the piazza. A few moments
later a rider sped past, and then another.
Then the fire-bells began to ring at
last—clang! clang! clang, clang, clang!</p>

<p>The fire was on the outskirts of the village,
in a different direction from that which Mr.
Harlow had taken in the morning. The
smoke rose a blacker and blacker column in
the distance, interspersed with sudden bursts
of flame. The crackling sound of burning
wood, the occasional sound of something
falling, and hoarse voices calling to one another
were borne faintly yet unmistakably
upon the air.</p>

<p>“I’m going to the fire!” It was Betty,
hat in hand, who had rushed down-stairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
breathless. “Come on, Syl! Oh, isn’t it
exciting! Just look at that blaze! There go
our boys!”</p>

<p>The street was filled with an outpouring of
bicycles with their riders, and with boys and
men coming in from the various games,
Herbert in one set, Jack in another. The
village was rapidly becoming deserted. Mrs.
Harlow began to wish she might go, too, but
she guaged the distance and forbore.</p>

<p>The fire had started in some outhouses, and
helped by a sudden breeze, had leaped merrily
over intervening space towards a large
barn that stretched out red and imposing
over one end of the field. Beyond that was
a dwelling-house. The barn, which was new,
while piled at one end with fodder, was as
yet untenanted by any animals, as Mr. Harlow
thankfully discovered on reaching the
place.</p>

<p>The stir in the village had not extended to
these outlying fields, which were all deserted,
as became a holiday. A woman stood in the
doorway of the house, watching the blaze.
One man was running off, shouting for help,
and another was carrying two buckets of
water towards the barn.</p>

<p>He came up to Mr. Harlow and put the
buckets on the ground.</p>

<p>“There ain’t any use in carryin’ water,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
said, “not a mite o’ use, only it seemed sort
o’ natural to do it. Just look at those
flames!”</p>

<p>“The engine ought to hurry up if it’s going
to do any good,” said Mr. Harlow.</p>

<p>“Can’t do a particle of good if it does
come. There ain’t any water here—that is,
not more than a teacupful; well and cistern’s
dry as a bone.”</p>

<p>“The house will not catch,” said Mr. Harlow;
“the wind is the other way. You are
sure there was no one in the barn?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the man.</p>

<p>They were gazing at the flames, which enveloped
one end of the structure. Another
moment, and there was a deafening crash
through the roar of the fire; half of the barn
had fallen in, and revealed beyond, high up
on one of the big beams of the rafters, the
white faces and crouching forms of six little
children, huddled close together. Playing in
the loft, they had climbed higher and higher
back, to get out of reach of the flames.</p>

<p>A cry of horror broke from the two onlookers.
The next instant the man, wildly shrieking
for help, followed Mr. Harlow, who sped
towards the barn.</p>

<p>The flames that had left one part of the
building still untouched were rapidly curling
round it, lighting up the faces of the children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
The roof sloped with a sharp pitch, but there
were a couple of projecting ledges below it.</p>

<p>Mr. Harlow had been an athlete in his day.
In spite of his large, heavily built frame, he
was still quick of motion, sure of foot, keen
of eye. He took off his coat and threw it on
the ground, and then in some way he was
climbing up the barn.</p>

<p>He disappeared, then reappeared again
inside. Swinging himself up on a blackened
rafter, he held with one hand to a support
above, and with the other lifted one half-insensible
child from her perch, and swung her
over into the waiting grasp of a fireman below,
for the engine had come up, and the
field was black with the whole swarming village
population, gathering larger and larger
forces each minute.</p>

<p>Six times did Mr. Harlow’s strong arm
plunge forward and encircle a helpless, drooping
little form in the sight of the field of
breathless spectators.</p>

<p>As the last one was safely handed over, a
sharp breath of relief came from the crowd.
Then there was a leaping flame, and a cloud
of smoke surged up and hid him from view.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The doctor says he’ll be all right soon.
Really, mother, we’re not keeping anything
from you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty, with high-keyed voice, flaming
cheeks and wild eyes, was under the impression
that she was pacifically calm of demeanour.
She had been taken home in a
friend’s buggy.</p>

<p>“There’s not the least cause for worry.
He’s only suffocated a little, you know, from
the smoke, and of course his hands are burned
a little, and his feet; and he’s not quite conscious
yet, but he’s all right. I was to tell
you that particularly, but you’re always so
nervous! They’ll have him home here soon.
Herbert’s with him, and Syl is bringing his
coat. And—O mother!”</p>

<p>Betty fell into Mrs. Harlow’s arms, and
they wept together.</p>

<p>“It was the most glorious thing you ever
saw!” said the daughter, brokenly. “Syl
and I reached the field just after Herbert and
Jack, and we heard some one saying, ‘Yes,
six children in there, but there’s a man trying
to get them out.’</p>

<p>“And then we saw a figure in the barn,
through the smoke, and Herbert cried, ‘It’s
father! it’s father!’ and ran forward, and
Jack and I just screamed, ‘It’s father! Oh,
it’s father!’ And oh, you ought to have
heard everybody, mother,—I’ll never forget
it,—and Jack cheered, but I could only cry,
‘It’s father!’ And then there was a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
a crash, and then lots of people came up and
told us he’d be all right soon, and Mr. Nevin
put me in his buggy and brought me home.
But if you’d seen how surprised everybody
was to find it was father! What’s the matter
with you, mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” said the mother. She had
drawn her form from her daughter’s embrace
and was standing erect. “It doesn’t surprise
me in the least. I always knew how brave
your father was. Why, when we were engaged
he saved a man from—O Betty, Betty,
here they come!”</p>

<p>It was a cavalcade led by Jack, with outriders
on bicycles and followers on foot, surrounding
an ancient barouche, on one seat
of which Mr. Harlow was solicitously propped
up by his son Herbert, his white face, grotesque
with scorched hair, smiling quizzical
encouragement at his wife.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” he said, in response to her
faltering, “O David!” “Such nonsense! I
don’t know what all this fuss is about.”</p>

<p>“We know, Mrs. Harlow,” said the doctor,
as he helped his charge out of the carriage
and up-stairs, still protesting, with bandages
on his hands and feet. He professed himself
as fit as a fighting cock to the wife who sat
by his side and gazed at him, while Betty and
Herbert received visitors and reporters below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
with the condescension of those of the blood
to the lesser nobility.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the third time.” Betty’s voice
had become attuned to the recital as the afternoon
wore on towards dusk. “Once he
rescued a man from the rapids in the St.
Lawrence River—my uncle said it was one
of the most daring deeds he ever witnessed;
and another time he stopped a runaway
horse, and saved two women from being
dashed against a stone wall. And another
time, when he was quite a boy, he had a fight
with two burglars in the dark, and forced
them—— What is it Herbert wants, Syl?
I’ll go up-stairs and see. Will you just take
this jelly that Mrs. Scovel brought over, and
put it where Jack can’t get at it?”</p>

<p>“Mother!” She opened the door of the
‘throne-room,’ where the invalid, propped,
up among his pillows, with a napkin under
his chin, had the air of an enormous infant as
his wife fed him with beef tea.</p>

<p>“Mother, there’s another reporter down-stairs.
Herbert says he wants one of father’s
pictures. There’s the telegraph boy riding up—it’s
the sixth message we’ve had. Jack,
bring it to me here! I’ll open it. It says,
‘Just heard the news. Love and congratulations
for our hero.’ It’s from Aunt Kitty.
Herbert wired her at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s the most fool business I ever heard
of,” said the man in the bed, helplessly.
“If I’d done anything, I wouldn’t mind,
but——”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, don’t excite yourself,” said his
wife, in soothing tone. “Betty——” She
gave her daughter a warning glance.</p>

<p>“I hope we’re through with all this tommy
rot,” said Mr. Harlow, as Betty’s footsteps
retreated.</p>

<p>He did not hear her voice again going on
fluently to a fresh batch of visitors: “Once
he rescued a man on the St. Lawrence River
from a stone wall—I mean the rapids, one of
the most daring deeds——”</p>

<p>“Min!”</p>

<p>“Yes, David.”</p>

<p>“Get my coat. Who’s that at the door
now?”</p>

<p>It was Herbert’s voice this time. “What
year was father born in?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” moaned the invalid. “Go
down and tell ’em you don’t know. Shut
that door! Get my coat, Min, and in the
inner left-hand side pocket—don’t hold it upside
down; you’ll let all my keys fall out;
there, I told you so—some of that change
rolled under the bed—never mind, look for it
later. The left-hand pocket, I said——”
Twenty-one years of matrimony had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
availed to teach Mrs. Harlow the intricacy of
her husband’s pockets. “Not that one;
there, now you’ve hit it! Take that letter
out.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the one you got from Tom this
morning!”</p>

<p>“Yes; open it, and read for yourself. Tell
me how it strikes you.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Harlow read, the colour rose in her
face. “Tom wishes to retire from active business—yes,
that’s what Kitty’s letter said. I
should think he’d have to, when—O David,
he says if you’ll take his place in the firm—he
has long been thinking of such an arrangement—David!”</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t take my hand, dear!” He
winced instinctively, but his tone was very
gentle. “Foolish woman, stop kissing those
bandages.”</p>

<p>“O David, now your worries will all be
over at last! The children had been planning
how they could help you. I wonder what it
will seem like to be able to buy anything new
once more. And perhaps we could take the
Morris house!”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I had been thinking of.
I was over there prowling round the place this
morning. I thought we’d go down and look
at it again together after dinner. And I’m
glad for your sake, Min, that I’m not such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
failure as it seemed, after all, dear. You
won’t have to be ashamed of your husband.
What’s that noise?”</p>

<p>There was the roll of drums and the sound
of flying footsteps, mingled with Betty’s hysterical
tones:</p>

<p>“O mother! O mother! Look out of
the window! The procession is stopping
outside!”</p>

<p>Like the Lady of Shalott, Mrs. Harlow made
three paces through the room to look beyond
her threshold. Before her dazed vision rose
ranks and ranks of men, crowding the street
before her doorway, with the flag in front.</p>

<p>Some one was waving the flag, and Herbert
was speaking, and then there was a cheer, and
another, and another, and yet another; but
she was not standing by the window; her face
was down by her husband’s.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she breathed, with a loving scorn in
her choking voice, as she touched the
bandaged hand that tried to seek hers, “I
don’t need to have you climb up burning
barns and rescue children, I don’t need to
have you ‘successful,’ as they call it, to know
who you are! If every one despised you, if
you were so poor you had to—dig—wells, I’d
still know you were the dearest, the bravest,
the best, the most wonderful man in all the
world! I’m just too proud of you to live!”</p>

<h3>The Portion of the Youngest</h3>

<p>“Big weddings are horrid. I think it’s
a great deal nicer to elope—my grandmother
eloped, and she was only sixteen
at the time, nearly two years younger
than I.”</p>

<p>“That is a very foolish way to talk, Tina;
times are quite different, now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why! Anyway, I hate weddings.
I only care for dances. Momsey,
aren’t you going to let me go to this dance?
What difference does it make if I’m <em>not</em> out?
All my friends are to be there—the Clarks,
and Edith Bayne and Francis Fanshawe.
Daddy said I could go before he went away,
and I’ve been counting on it all the time, and
now you won’t let me!”</p>

<p>Tina sat on an ottoman in the centre of the
big, mahogany-furnished, old-fashioned room,
with her light hair falling over one ear and
her large, clear, blue eyes fixed tragically on
the face of the parent who sat busily sewing.
Tina’s slim shoulders were hunched forward
and her feet crossed in the attitude which
always brought forth her mother’s rebuke:</p>

<p>“Don’t sit that way, dear; it’s very unladylike.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
How often have I told you, Tina, that
if you get in the habit of sitting like that
when we’re alone you’ll do it when you don’t
realize it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Malison’s voice had the tone of a well-worn
persistency. She was a young-looking
woman for her years, and still handsome
enough to make the resemblance to her
youngest daughter very apparent even to
the obstinate little curve of the short upper
lip. The answer was almost as automatic:</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t <em>care</em>! Momsey, why won’t
you let me go to the dance?”</p>

<p>“Now, Tina, what is the use of teasing
mother any more about that?” said the second
daughter, coming into the room. Elinor
was small and dark, with finely marked eyebrows,
regular features, and an expression of
great intelligence, wrecked at times by a
shattering wave of nervousness. At the moment
she carried in her hand a bird’s bathtub,
filled with water, destined for the cage
over by the window, where a brown and dishevelled
canary hung mopingly from a perch.
She went on:</p>

<p>“You know perfectly well that mother
thinks you’ve been staying up a great deal
too late in the evening. You cannot study
and go out at the same time. And she told
you she didn’t approve of your being so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
with Francis Fanshawe—none of us do. He
may be a nice enough boy, but he isn’t our
kind. We all of us think you’d better let the
acquaintance drop.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you don’t want me to do <em>anything</em>!”
Tina’s eyes began to sparkle ominously.
“It doesn’t make the slightest difference
to me when you talk that way about
my friends. I like them, no matter what you
and Annette say. You’ve always been down
on Francis! And I don’t care whether
I keep on with my studies or not.”</p>

<p>“Tina!” Elinor carefully inserted the
bathtub in the cage before flinging herself
volubly upon the subject. “Tina, you can’t
mean that—you want to be educated, I hope!
Besides, you’ll enjoy coming out into society
a great deal more later, and if you’re seen
everywhere now, people will be taking you
for much older than you are.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care!” Tina’s defiant tone
took on an increasing rapidity. “I don’t see
what good it does to be educated, anyway.
People like you just as well when you’re silly.
I think it’s dreadfully stupid to go to college
the way you did and get so critical, and never
see any fun in things, and analyze everybody
the way you do Robert Harper, so that you
never know whether you like him or not. I
wish you’d take enough interest in him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
get him to shave off that horrid, little, black
mustache—it makes him look so sleek! I
don’t care for what they teach in books. It
doesn’t do me any good to learn about the
ancient Egyptians and the battles of the Civil
War, and write Enoch Arden over upside
down; I hate Enoch Arden, he makes me so
<em>cross</em>—— I care for automobiles, and skating
and having a good time with my friends,
and <em>dancing</em>. And it’s no use telling me I’ll
enjoy myself more later. I want to enjoy
myself now! Maybe there won’t <em>be</em> any
‘later’; maybe I’ll be dead.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how you make a bird take a
bath,” said Elinor in an absorbed tone. She
regarded the canary with a baffled eye.
“I’ve had the water warm and I’ve had it
cold; I’ve put the tub in every position I can
think of, and left it there for half a day at
a time, and he only hops around and looks
at it.” Her voice rose in sudden, nervous
excitement. “I don’t know <em>what</em> to do. He
hasn’t taken a bath in a week. He <em>must</em> take
a bath!”</p>

<p>“You get in and show him how,” jibed
Tina, with a delighted childish giggle. She
jumped up from the ottoman, swooping her
arms down to embrace the mother, who still
sat sewing. “All right momsey, I’m to go
to the dance; it’s all settled. Let me try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Tweetums, Elinor!” she ran over to the
cage, brushing her sister to one side. Tina
seemed to take the light with her when she
moved; it clung around her bright hair, and
radiated from her fair skin and her dear eyes,
and even lurked, shimmering, in the folds of
her sky-blue gown. She stood with upraised
head touching the gilded wires of the cage,
talking in tender, caressing sound to the little
feathered rebel, with a lure of sugar crumbs
upon her red lips, until he came to peck at
them. What made the transition—what
magic was hers? There was a sudden
splash, a shower of raindrops over her laughing,
triumphant face as she started back, before
she ran from the room. Tina had the
winning way.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard Tina in here,” said a
taller sister, entering by another door. Annette
was perhaps not so pretty as the other
two, but she had a large, blonde gentleness,
very reposefully attractive. She had been
engaged for four years to a charming fellow,
whose only lack was that of money, consequent
on a dependent mother and sisters.
The lovers had preserved the spirit of romance
by varying the manifestations of it—for
the last twelvemonth spending their time
with note-book and pencil, raptly ciphering
out the future possibilities of a livelihood for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
two on the narrowest known limit. Although
Annette and Joseph had seen each other
nearly every evening during this probation
her soft eyes suffused and her soft cheeks
rosed as virginally on the thousandth time
he appeared as on the first.</p>

<p>She held up a garment now as she spoke.
“I want to give this new waist to Tina to
mend. Just see where she’s torn it! I found
it under her desk.”</p>

<p>“Now, Annette, if you’ve been putting her
room to rights again——!” Elinor held up
her hands in despair.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stand seeing it the way it was,”
said Annette apologetically.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, that’s the way you spoil
her. I’m sure you and I were brought up
very differently. Here, give me a needle
and thread, she’ll never mend that waist.
Mother, now you’ve let Tina think she’s
going to the dance, that settles it; you
can’t go back on it now: but I think she
ought to understand that <em>this</em> is absolutely
the last time.”</p>

<p>“She seemed to take it so to heart,” said
the mother weakly. She tried to rally herself
intelligently. “Of course I don’t mind
her accepting invitations occasionally; she’s
nearly eighteen; but the girls who are not
out have more going on than the girls that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
are. And that young Fanshawe—he seems
a stupid sort of a boy, to me; but he does
such reckless things I do <em>not</em> like to have
Tina with him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, he’s all right, really, he’s
only young.” Annette’s tone was gently
protesting. “He’s so much richer than the
others that he can do more things—that’s
all; she’ll soon get tired of him. All the
boys in that set are devoted to Tina. When
a girl is as pretty as she is——” The three
looked at each other in the pause that followed,
but each saw only the image of the
beloved youngest.</p>

<p>Tina, indeed, was in that stage of rebellion
at life in which she could see no meaning in
any law of her elders; her young desire controverted
all their worldly experience. What
was the use of saying she couldn’t want to
do things when she patently did? Refusal
hardened her; reason was only that which
darkeneth understanding. She resented any
appeal to her affection, not because she had
little, but because she had so much that she
fought being mastered by it, and thrown into
those hated fits of weeping and contrition.
She stormily wanted what she wanted. Yet
if she were left untrammelled she showed unexpected
glimpses of a heart passionately
loving and tender; an undercurrent as old as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the world, as deep as life, profoundly affecting.
Tina was the only one of the family
who had “temperament,” a fact dimly perceived
only in the desire to shield the child
from something unknown. At present there
was the uneasy feeling that this something
might be a youthful attachment for Francis
Fanshawe.</p>

<p>To the critical eye, young Fanshawe, an
orphan, was simply a stolid and uninteresting
young fellow of twenty-one, tall, heavily
built, and reddish in hair and complexion.
Elinor characterized him as “thuddy,” a
word coined by the family to indicate the
quality of weight. He had no expression,
and was tongue-tied in the presence of his
elders, even the sympathetic Annette failing
to elicit response from him, though with
the youth of his own “set” Francis seemed
to be voluble enough in the loud exchange
of catch phrases and slangy interjections
which made their happy intercourse, and he
and Tina could talk by the hour together in
a murmuring undertone. He was rather
dangerously well off in a community where
only the fathers had money, a fact in itself
calculated to affect his reputation. But his
light-blue eyes could look squarely into
yours, and he had a good grip of the hand.
He was undoubtedly a nice enough boy if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
you liked that kind, though Elinor could only
wonder that anybody did. She herself only
liked people who interested and stimulated.</p>

<p>With Elinor a lover was a creature to be
analyzed mercilessly under the suspicion that
otherwise he might get some power over one
by sheer force of his affection; he was
pictured in all sorts of impossible situations
to test his attraction, every barrier was
erected that ingenuity could devise. The
way Elinor “treated” Robert was one of the
stock subjects of interest and reprehension in
the family, though Robert, intelligent, darkly
good-looking and ineffective, was simply
pleased if she was pleasant, and patiently
snubbed when she wasn’t. Annette and
Joseph—that patently good fellow who had
had the courage of his convictions four years
ago—enjoyed their little confidences of
amused laughter over the situation. Still,
precedent had made an engagement of marriage
something to be very thoughtfully entered
into, or necessarily prolonged. When
it came to Tina——</p>

<p>Mrs. Malison wrote to her husband, as he
did to her, every night during his long absences
from home. She reposed so thoroughly
in theory on his judgment that neither
of them realized that in practice she decided
everything. Her resolution to restrict the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
girl’s gaieties was suddenly hardened by the
events of the dance, though it was twenty-four
hours before she got a chance to express
it, Tina having slept until the late afternoon
in defiance of her pledge to study, and visitors
taking up the rest of the day. One
visitor, indeed, was partly responsible for the
mother’s steadily increasing purpose; kind,
elderly, little Miss Ward in her neat black
jacket, trimmed with a mysterious ginger-coloured
fur, being one of those amiable conversationalists
who scatter the seeds of discomfort
wherever they tread. Mrs. Malison,
although she knew from aforetime what she
had to expect, couldn’t help the usual thrill
of exasperation at the opening sentence:</p>

<p>“How fleshy you are growing! I said the
other day as you were passing, ‘I hardly
knew Mrs. Malison, she’s getting so stout;
it’s easy to see that she doesn’t let things
worry <em>her</em>!’ Your husband looked very
badly, I think, when he was here last. I
want to apologize for not coming before to
congratulate Miss Elinor on her engagement
to Mr. Harper.”</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Ward, you have been misinformed”—Mrs.
Malison felt that she was
holding herself well in hand—“Elinor would
be very much obliged to you, I’m sure—but
there is no engagement.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, now, isn’t that singular!” Miss
Ward’s small features indicated a deep and
wondering interest. “I certainly understood
from Mrs. Painter that Ethel said it was announced;
I know she mentioned that every
one was talking of it. I was there yesterday
looking at the things Mrs. Painter brought
over from the other side—beautiful, aren’t
they? She gave me a lovely little framed
photograph from some place in Italy—Sorrento,
I think; you can get them here for a
quarter, but of course it’s the <em>thought</em> you
value. She showed me the most exquisite
laces—and hats——! Six of them; perfect
dreams. How pretty <em>your</em> hat looks this
year; you’ve had such good wear out of it,
too, haven’t you? I’m sure <em>I</em> never mind if
a thing isn’t in the newest style! Oh, by the
way, my sister was one of the chaperons
with you last night at the young people’s
dance. She said Miss Tina evidently enjoyed
herself if one could judge by her actions—quite
a case, isn’t she! And so noticeable-looking,
too. Of course, when she gets as
old as your other daughters she’ll sober
down; I’m sure, as I told my sister, you
never see them doing anything conspicuous.”</p>

<p>Conspicuous! The word of all others calculated
to bring the blood to a mother’s
cheek. Mrs. Malison trembled almost visibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
with her effort at self-control, as she
switched the conversation further afield,
though she saw as plainly as on the night
before the lighted ballroom and the tall, lissome,
white-clad figure of Tina, with gleaming
golden hair and scintillating eyes, “holding
hands” with Francis Fanshawe in ring-around-a-rosy
fashion, now high above her
head, now swinging low down, as the two
went flying across the floor, not once, but
many times, with an exaggerated, heel-and-toe,
boy-and-girl sportiveness after every one
else was seated and the music had grown as
freakishly mad as they. Mrs. Malison had
not realized at first that it was Tina. Then,
after that whispered rebuke they had disappeared
until it was nearly time to go home,
emerging finally, on being sent for, from a
palm-hidden corner of the enclosed balcony,
Tina with very flushed cheeks, hazy eyes and
a general air of having been Called Back,
too plain to be mistaken—a perfectly open,
childlike defiance of inevitable comment that
made one moan in ludicrous dismay. There
is nothing so patently open to criticism as innocence.
Even through the “thuddiness”
of Francis there showed the glitter of an eye
which told of the spirit within. Mrs. Malison’s
annoyance had culminated when she
spoke to Tina on the second morning. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
was fully nerved for struggle. This thing
had to stop.</p>

<p>“Tina, I have been waiting for an opportunity
to speak to you about the ball. I was
very much displeased with your behaviour;
<em>very</em> much displeased! I felt obliged to
write to your father about it. I cannot allow
you to go to another dance this winter.”</p>

<p>“All right; I don’t want to,” said Tina
uninterestedly.</p>

<p>She had thrown herself down on the wicker
lounge beside a black poodle stretched out
on the Roman-striped coverlet, and putting
her arms around the animal surveyed her
mother from this position. Mrs. Malison’s
eyes feasted on the picture.</p>

<p>“Tina, you are entirely too young to do as
you please. You know nothing about the
consequences. After this you are to attend
to your studies. I don’t wish you to be seen
with Francis Fanshawe any more; and I
don’t wish you to invite him here.”</p>

<p>“He’s not coming,” said Tina briefly.
“Momsey, I want a new grey suit! I know
I had this green one last month, but I hate
it. All my friends are getting grey suits
now.”</p>

<p>“Tina, have you quarrelled with Francis?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Malison looked uncomfortably puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then—— Has he done anything you
don’t like, dear?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything that you’re keeping
from me?” In spite of denial, Mrs. Malison
felt the tenacity of some purpose that she
could not fathom.</p>

<p>“No; oh, <em>no</em>!” Tina raised her voice at
the sight of her two sisters in the doorway.
“You can come in; momsey’s finished scolding
me. I want a new grey suit—all my
friends have grey suits!”</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” Elinor’s tone was
exasperated. “Another new suit—when Annette
and I have been wearing our old ones
all winter! That’s so like you, Tina, never considering
where the money is to come from.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care where the money comes
from! Annette, don’t you think I can have
it?”</p>

<p>“It seems a little foolish, dear—unless you
could wear it later in the season,” began Annette
pacifically. “By the way, I heard you
say that Francis wasn’t coming here. I
thought he was going to take you and Edith
to the school concert to-night.”</p>

<p>“No; Robert’s going to take us,” said
Tina. She detached herself from her sisters’
embrace and ran away, with the black poodle
after her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Robert,” repeated Elinor meditatively;
she sat down in the chair her mother had just
vacated and stared at Annette. “How very
odd! Robert has never taken Tina anywhere.
She must have written to him. That child
does the most unexpected things! I was
wondering last night if I would care for
Robert if he were quite different. Some men
have such a brutal streak in them. On the
other hand, you like a man to know his own
mind and keep to it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” assented Annette absently.
She dropped down on the lounge. “Joseph
and I were figuring last night that if we had
two dollars more a month we might really
get married. That would include the twenty-five
cents a week for doctor’s bills—I suppose
we ought to allow that.” She stopped
a moment to switch onto another track. “It
seemed to me there was something odd in
Tina’s manner this morning, Elinor; I think
she has some plan about Francis!”</p>

<p>As that week went on, and the next and
the next, it became apparent to all that there
was a change in the dear little youngest.
She threw herself into her studies with exemplary
conscientiousness, she performed her
small, appointed tasks with the modicum of
fractiousness. She went out nowhere. She
was as lively and capricious as she had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
been, and although she celebrated
her eighteenth birthday, seemed younger
than ever; but through it all there was an
odd change—an absence of earnestness when
she was earnest, an absence of mirth when
she was mirthful. In some unexplained way
Tina wasn’t with them; something ineffably
bright and soul-inspiring had dropped out of
the household. The loss of it made a growing
little undercurrent of uneasiness, of anxiety.
Through all the daily living there is
in every home a fateful knowledge of the unexpressed.</p>

<p>It is impossible to hide one’s secrets. The
whole family felt sure that Tina was thinking
of Francis Fanshawe, though she never even
looked out of the window when he spun past
it, as sometimes happened, in his big, white
motor car, filled with a gay crowd of bugle-blowing
boys. Elinor, with the tacit consent
of her elders, actually wrote a note inviting
him to the house. He came, indeed, but
Tina refused to see him, playing checkers up-stairs
in the library with Robert, who had a
meditative, humorous way of beating her,
while Elinor, perforce, did the entertaining.
The big youth was not unpleasing, as she
owned afterwards, though he said next to
nothing, but his blue eyes looked unusually
appreciative and he gripped her hand so hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
when he left that her fingers were nearly
welded into each other.</p>

<p>It was at the end of the month that Tina
came into her mother’s room one morning
with an unexpected rush, her golden head
thrown back, the black poodle barking delightedly
at her heels. There was a note in
her voice which had not been there in these
four weeks past, as she said:</p>

<p>“Momsey, I’ve something to say to you.”</p>

<p>“Well, come over here, dear. I want to
hook you up; your dress is all open in the
back. I wish you would be more careful.
Isn’t it time for you to go to your lessons?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to study any more,
mother.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I’ve decided that I want to get married,”
said Tina—“to Francis.” A wave of colour
rose suddenly over her lovely face, and
she made an annoyed motion as if to brush
it away. “Annette knows I want to marry
him. I wanted her to tell you, but she said
you wouldn’t like it unless I told you myself.
So now I’m telling you. And I hope you
won’t mind very much, for Francis and I will
never care for any one else.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear child!” said Mrs. Malison.
Mother and daughter looked at each other
with the same expression of dominant will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
“This is, of course, nonsense, Tina.” She
braced herself as one does against a coming
blow so appalling that one cannot stop to
fear the weight of it; all one’s energies must
be used to fend it off.</p>

<p>“It distresses me to hear you talk like
this; you don’t mean it—you don’t know
<em>what</em> it means; but it distresses me, Tina!”</p>

<p>“There, I knew you’d say that!” cried Tina
in poignant remonstrance. She dropped
into her favourite attitude of hunched up
shoulders, her lips set in scornful bitterness.
“Every one lectures me and scolds me—nobody
wants me to do anything I like except
Francis. Even Robert lectures me, though
he’s such a muff with Elinor! I know none
of you like Francis. I know you all despise
him, but he’s a thousand times nicer to me
than any one else is. He likes me to have
everything I want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tina!” said poor Mrs. Malison, her
heart pierced with twenty daggers. “Of
course, I’m not saying—— If you still care for
him in a couple of years, then, perhaps, your
father and I may consider it. But you can’t
know your own mind now, my darling. You
have seen nothing of life; marriage is a very
serious thing.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t want to wait until I know
about life, if it’s as horrid as you say it is!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
said Tina, hotly. “I don’t want to wait until
I change my mind. I’ll never change it. I
made Francis stay away on purpose all last
month to see what it would be like—and I
<em>hated</em> it—and so did he.” Tina’s voice had
the ring of a passionate conviction, her blue
eyes had a sombre depth of melancholy in
them. “Why do we have to wait for years
and years like Annette and Joseph when it
isn’t necessary? Mother, why can’t Francis
and I be married? My grandmother was
married at sixteen.”</p>

<p>“And would you leave your father and me,
Tina, when we’ve taken care of you, and loved
you, so much?” Mrs. Malison’s voice shook,
she fastened her eyes on her daughter with
anguish. Tina’s mouth took on the obstinate
curve which the too obvious appeal to her
affections always brought there. She didn’t
even take the trouble to answer as she tapped
irritatingly on the floor with her small foot.
The silence conveyed even more forcibly than
words that it was a recognized fact that people
left their parents when they married
without discredit attaching to them—it was
part of the plan. Even through her wretchedness
Mrs. Malison drearily acquiesced in
the received view of the matter! but for Tina—her
baby—— Ah, that was a different
thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>For Tina’s own good this time she must
not have her way.</p>

<p>The mother went around all day with a
stone on her heart, that made her face white
and drawn and breathing difficult, while
Annette and Elinor talked excitedly and incessantly
with household avocations half
done, and sought the dear little wayward
sister separately afterwards, Annette with
mute caresses, and larges pieces of bread and
jam to supplement the lack of a breakfast, and
Elinor with intelligent reasoning as she put
the child’s collar straight and fastened her
belt. Tina had never dressed herself alone
in her life. “I thought I cared for Tommy
Burns, Tina, when I was seventeen, and as
for even looking at him now——! When
it comes down to it, dear, what men have
you ever seen?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen—Robert,” said Tina dangerously,
under her breath.</p>

<p>Elinor’s arms fell away from her office of
tiring woman; she stood staring.</p>

<p>“Robert——?”</p>

<p>Tina’s eyes gleamed with a daring, revealing,
lightning flash: “Well, if you’re never
nice to a person yourself, Elinor——” She
escaped to the doorway for a parting shot.</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>Robert</em>!” she called back elfishly,
and fled, passing her mother with no recognition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and actually going out in young Fanshawe’s
car with him for all the afternoon,
only coming back in time for dinner, which
was a state function, with guests, and going
to bed immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>It is strange how one untoward event disrupts
all the working order of the mind; that
which has given joy loses its flavour, that
which has been counted on as sure becomes
fluctuant. Everything has to arrange itself
anew. If Elinor wrote a note to a Robert who
had neglected to appear, it was not from the
dictates of reason, but from a novel and jealous
desire for his presence. If Annette and
Joseph sat up unusually late after the guests
had departed it was, perhaps, because figuring
over a housekeeping text-book wasn’t as
satisfying as sometimes, and they had to
keep at it a little longer to capture the pleasure
of that future living together. Even to
the most unselfish, the most vernally patient
of lovers waiting may show a grim face, all
“bare of bliss” at times, especially when confronted
with a boy of twenty-one who has
money and to spare for that leap over the
matrimonial barriers. It was only after thoroughly
studying a mysterious way of Approaching
a Butcher, by which, although
special cuts and roasts were so much a pound,
you got a whole diagrammic ox for a dollar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
that that prophetic feeling of happiness
mingled once more with the lovers’ goodnight
kiss. Heaven only knows what delicate
sentiment was embedded in those visionary
steaks and chops!</p>

<p>Long after Joseph had gone Mrs. Malison
and Annette talked in the mother’s room,
with low, painfully murmuring voices, taking
counsel together into the small hours. It
was three of the clock when the hurrying of
soft footsteps and a touch at the chamber
door startled them, and then a piteous voice:</p>

<p>“Momsey; oh, momsey!”</p>

<p>The mother was up on the instant, opening
the door; by the light in the hall, Tina’s eyes,
ice-blue, stared at her over the lace frills of
her night-dress. “I came to tell you—if you
feel like that—the way you looked to-day—I’ll
tell Francis I won’t marry him; it will <em>kill</em>
me; but if you are happy it doesn’t make
any difference. I can’t <em>stand</em> seeing you
look like that! It will kill me, but you’ll
be happier, any way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” said Mrs. Malison in despair—anxiety
lent roughness to her voice.
“This is nonsense, Tina. Come up-stairs
this minute. The idea! with nothing on
your feet—you’ll get your death of cold.”
She led the girl to her own bed, tucking the
soft form with resolute fingers, and lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
down herself afterwards under the coverlet
with her cheek against Tina’s chill flesh.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tina, as if mother could ever be
glad if you were unhappy! It’s just because
I fear that if you have what you want that it
will only be for your unhappiness that I look
as I do. If your father were only at home!”</p>

<p>Tina gave a movement of impatience,
though she lay close cuddled in her mother’s
arms. “I think it would have been a great
deal better if we had eloped—Francis and I,”
she murmured.</p>

<p>“Tina!” The mother gave a horrified
gasp.</p>

<p>“Well, I do think so—it would have saved
everything, all the feeling so badly, and the
talk, and everything. Francis and I wanted
to go off in the automobile this afternoon and
get married then, and settle it all at once.
People never seem to mind a bit after it’s all
over—the Boggses made such a fuss about
Lucy’s marrying that widower and now nobody
says a word about it. She comes to
Sunday-night’s tea with <em>his</em> children.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t elope, my darling,” said
Mrs. Malison, searching for the one crumb of
comfort.</p>

<p>“Francis thought you might mind.”</p>

<p>“That was <em>very</em> right of Francis.”</p>

<p>“And he was afraid the car would break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
down; he had to take it to the garage for
repairs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed the poor mother once
more.</p>

<p>It was only after Tina seemed to be asleep
that she stole down-stairs again to drop into
an uneasy slumber herself.</p>

<p>This battle was going to be a long and
weary fray.</p>

<p>They were all down unusually early to
breakfast but Tina.</p>

<p>“Don’t waken Miss Tina,” Mrs. Malison
warned the maid.</p>

<p>“Sure she’s not in the house, ma’am.”
Emma’s tone was glibly important. “Bridget
said as how Miss Tina slipped out at six
o’clock this morning; she came down the
stairs a tiptoe in her new grey shuit. ’Twas
towards the trolley car she wint.”</p>

<p>It had happened then already—the blow
had fallen! The headstrong child had gone.
Mrs. Malison whispered the words with lips
that could hardly frame the words. Other
people’s daughters had deceived them and
done this thing—she had felt shamed for
them—but hers! The room went around
with her, some one was bringing her water.
She saw the scared faces of Annette and
Elinor bending over her—the moments seemed
like dreary years as they passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>The square, marble-pillared clock, in its
old-fashioned glass case on the mantel, chimed
eight musically as Tina came into the room.
Her blue hat with its white feathers was
pushed sideways on her rumpled hair, and
the new grey suit was wrinkled and spotted
with clay from an enormous pot of daisies
hugged tightly in her arms. She set it down
hastily on the white cloth of the breakfast
table, and leaned back, panting, against the
mahogany sideboard laden with its tall old
silver; the light from the parting of the heavy
curtains leaped towards her, and held her in
its shining embrace.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that was going to be so
heavy. The trolleys were <em>so</em> slow, they
wouldn’t connect. I went to get the flowers
for you, momsey, because you’re so fond of
them.”</p>

<p>Her eyes took swift tally of the group, unheeding
of their exclamations. “Please leave
the room, Emma——” she went on speaking
with a defiant hardness, broken now and then
by an odd, piteous little catch in her young
voice:</p>

<p>“I suppose you thought I’d eloped. I
promise you now that I won’t; I won’t get
married until you and daddy say I can. I’ll
wait <em>forever</em> if you say so. I can’t bear to
hurt any one’s feelings. But I’ll never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
happy here at home any more, and I’ll never
care for anybody here. I may act as if I
cared, but I won’t, really! I’ll only care for
Francis—as he cares for me.” The wind
from some far source seemed to shake her
with its ruthless power. “You think I’m so
young—you make me younger than I really
am so that I don’t know how to tell you what
I mean—to tell you so that you’ll understand.
When I’m with Francis he doesn’t need to
speak, he doesn’t even need to be <em>near</em> me;
but I’m just so happy!” Her voice had
changed to the exquisite cadence of love.
“It’s my <em>own</em> life! And whether I’m glad
or sorry, I want to spend it with him.
I want to be with him anyway—I want to be
with him if I <em>die</em> for it!”</p>

<p>She put her hand on her heart with a
quick, passionate gesture, her ice-blue eyes
had in them that look which is as old as the
world, as deep as life. She stepped past the
weeping sisters to throw herself on her knees
by her mother, to hide her bright head upon
her mother’s breast, to reach her young arms
up to clasp around her mother’s neck as she
whispered:</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, mother, <em>you ought to know</em>!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It certainly was a beautiful wedding!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Little Miss Ward was calling once more at
the Malisons; her voice was earnestly kind.
“How lovely Miss Annette and Miss Elinor
looked. I never saw girls keep their looks
so well! And Miss Elinor engaged, too, at
<em>last</em>! Every one was so surprised at Miss
Tina’s getting married so soon. Mr. Fanshawe
seemed very happy, I shouldn’t
wonder if there really was more to him
than people think; he shook my hand so—<em>cordially</em>,
it’s a little lame yet. And as for
the bride”—Miss Ward lowered her voice
tenderly—“well, Mrs. Grandison said, when
she saw that child’s sweet, young face going
up the aisle, there was something so pathetic
about it that she just broke down and gave
up and cried, when she thought of all that
might be before her. Have you ever thought
what a lottery life is?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Malison. She had indeed!
For good or for evil the portion of
the youngest was Tina’s. She had had, as
always, her own way.</p>

<h3>Polly Townsend’s Rebellion</h3>

<p>The goings forth and the comings back
of the head of a suburban household
are the pendulum by which all the rest
of the time swings. Polly Townsend, in a
short white duck skirt, with a cheerful red
bow in her light hair, was putting the finishing
touches to the dinner-table in the now
permanent absence of the “girl,” and listening
for the returning footstep of her husband
with more than her usual sense of expectation,
which lately had been braced to divine
what that footstep might imply as to the day’s
success or non-success.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend was “out of a position,” a
stage of tenuous existence over which self-respecting
families draw a decent veil. In
the three months of his detachment he had
experienced all its usual effects in his relations
with a comfortably occupied world—the sympathetic
indignation and inefficient, helpful
efforts in his behalf, with the haphazard,
temporary “jobs,” the gradual subsidence of
poignant interest, and, finally, the semi-irritation
at his “not having anything yet,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
which would really seem to imply a culpable
torpidity on his part to all but the wife who
alone knew the struggle which he no longer
heralded abroad. Her indignation daily
burned stronger against the friends who
couldn’t seem to do anything for him, but
who were themselves successful without half
of his talent.</p>

<p>She herself had done what she could, besides
looking after the house and the two
children. For ten weeks she had secretly
given music lessons to the child of a
friend, steadily refusing payment until the
end of the term, and she now held in the little
bag at her belt the princely sum of seven
dollars and fifty cents, all her own, and destined
for great uses. Mrs. Townsend was,
above all things, a woman of action, and to
resolve was to dare immediately.</p>

<p>It was with a faint sigh of farewell to a
hope barely entertained that she heard the
aggressive briskness of her husband’s tread,
and she answered the florid cheerfulness of
his greeting with the studied carelessness of
custom in the well-worn words:</p>

<p>“Nothing new to-day, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing new,” said Mr. Townsend
heartily. He was a large, attractive-looking
man, with the slightly greyish hair which had
handicapped him so much in getting a position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
though his wife was eagerly ready to
tell every one how really young he was.</p>

<p>“Dinner’s about ready, I see; well I’m
ready for it.” He relapsed into a chair by
the table as he spoke. “Where are the children?”</p>

<p>“They’re spending the evening at the
Mays’,” said his wife, bringing in the hot
dishes from the kitchen and taking quick
note of his unconscious lassitude and the new
wrinkles in his broad forehead. “We can
have a quiet, little cozy time all by ourselves.
Would you mind tying the thread around this
rag on my finger? I sliced it when I was
peeling the potatoes.”</p>

<p>“You dash at everything so,” remonstrated
the husband, accomplishing the thread-tying
slowly and painstakingly. “I should think
you would learn to be more careful after you
had burned yourself so badly. Stand still.
Don’t be in such a hurry; the dinner can
wait.”</p>

<p>“No, it can’t,” said Mrs. Townsend, escaping
to the head of the table. “Have you seen
any one to-day?”</p>

<p>“About seven hundred people.”</p>

<p>“Francis! You know what I mean. Have
you seen any one I know?”</p>

<p>“No. Yes, I did see Harry Jenkins for a
moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did he have to say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Francis!” Mrs. Townsend looked
despairing. “Why do you make me drag
things out of you this way? Didn’t he tell
you anything about his wife’s return from
England——?”</p>

<p>“Not a word.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t ask——?”</p>

<p>“My dear Polly, I saw him for about two
seconds, crossing the street on his way to the
tailor’s. If that can give you any satisfaction
you’re welcome to it.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could go to the tailor’s,” said
Mrs. Townsend deeply, with a sudden moistening
of her luminous grey eyes. “I wish—I
wish your clothes weren’t getting so—so——”</p>

<p>“It will soon be cold enough for my overcoat,”
said her husband consolingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but—Francis! I’ve been
wanting to speak to you for ever so long.
Those trousers you have on—really, you
know they were always perfectly hideous. I
nearly cried when you brought them home.
How a man who has always dressed as well
as you have could ever have chosen those
things! Of course, I know you only bought
them because they were so cheap, but there’s
always a choice. And now they’re so shabby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
it makes me positively sick to see you in
them. Last Sunday when you passed the
plate in church—well, you thought I went
out because I was faint, but it was simply
because I couldn’t sit there and see you walk
up the aisle and stand in front of the whole
congregation until that anthem was finished.”</p>

<p>“Let’s change the subject,” said Mr. Townsend.
“It’s a fine day.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t change the subject. Do you
know they’re advertising trousers at Brooker’s—such
a good place!—for six dollars. Mrs.
Bond says her husband got two pairs there
yesterday—the very best quality. And—I
want you to buy a pair to-morrow. She says
they wear forever.”</p>

<p>“Where could I get the six dollars?” asked
Mr. Townsend facetiously.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d say that. Oh, Francis! I
have the money right here. I earned it myself.”
Mrs. Townsend rose and swept her
chair down beside her husband. “I never
told you a word, but I’ve been giving Alice
May music lessons ever since—Francis! Now
see here, you’re not going to mind! How
perfectly absurd! It’s been a real pleasure.
Mrs. May paid me seven dollars and a-half
to-day. Now, Francis, I want you to take
this money and buy those trousers to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see myself—farther,” said Mr.
Townsend comprehensively. He half rose,
and pushed her gently from him. “I’d like
to see myself take—take your little money.
Spend it on yourself, now you’ve got it, or
on the children if you want to—heaven knows
you need things badly enough! I won’t
touch a cent of it.”</p>

<p>“But Francis, you must! You never can
get a position dressed as you are; you look
like—— Clothes make such a difference! Oh,
I didn’t want to say it but—Francis, you’ve
got to take the money.” She strove to put it
in his pocket and he thrust forth her hand with
a grip that held her slender wrist like a vise.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Polly. You don’t know how
your having to earn it hurts me; I haven’t
the right to forbid it but”—he stopped, and
forced down something—“I haven’t come to
such a pass that I’ll take your money to buy
my clothes.” He fixed her sternly with a
masterful eye. “There’s no use in your persisting.
I’ll tell you once for all that I won’t
do it; and I don’t want to hear any more on
the subject.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mrs. Townsend soothingly,
in the tone of one who bides her time.
She added afterwards in protest, “You haven’t
half eaten your dinner—and I took such pains
with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think—you make it so nicely—but I
think I’m just a little tired of stew,” said Mr.
Townsend apologetically.</p>

<p>Later she found him rummaging in his
closet, appearing as he heard her step to say
explanatorily:</p>

<p>“I want to see if I can’t find another pair
of trousers to wear to-morrow. I guess I’d
better leave these I have on for you to fix up
a little. The fact is—I didn’t tell you before,
for I don’t want you to raise your hopes in
any way—but I’ve at last got an appointment
for the day after to-morrow to see Mr. Effingham.”</p>

<p>“An appointment with Mr. Effingham!
Oh, Francis!”</p>

<p>“Cartwright’s letter was what did it. Cartwright
says Effingham is the kind of a fellow
who either likes you or doesn’t like you,
straight off the bat. I tell you, I think a lot
of Cartwright’s writing all the way from
Chicago about this, taking so much pains
for a man that’s almost a stranger to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you never do anything for people
yourself!” said his wife sarcastically.</p>

<p>“I never did anything for Cartwright—except
put his wife once on the right train,”
said Mr. Townsend. “Now, what’s the matter
with these trousers?” He held up a pair
for inspection. “They look all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, nothing’s the matter, nothing whatever,”
said his wife scornfully, “except that
they’re full of moth holes. Those are the
winter trousers—the only good pair you had—that
you left at your sister’s—you said you
could get them any time—and she had them
stuffed into a dark closet this summer while
she was away in the country; she just sent
them over Monday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember,” said Mr. Townsend
hastily. “You’d better get rid of them.
Now, here’s a pair—I didn’t know I had any
so good.”</p>

<p>“Those are the ones you painted the attic
in last spring,” said Mrs. Townsend, “and
the pair next are what you keep for fishing.
Those belong to your dress-suit, and the
ones beyond are too short, and worn all over
so that you were afraid to put them on.”</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend surveyed the last named
with raised eyebrows and a consenting,
cornerwise glance at his wife. “Yes, they
are pretty bad—but I guess I’d better wear
them to-morrow while you fix up these.”</p>

<p>“Francis, if you’re going to see Mr.
Effingham you’ll just have to buy a pair of
trousers.”</p>

<p>He turned on her sternly as he said:
“Didn’t I tell you not to speak of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I will speak of it!” Mrs. Townsend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hurled herself into the fray. “Francis,
I can’t help it! When I think of all you’ve
suffered, and all you’ve done, and how much
depends now on—oh, my dearest!” she tried
to put her head on an eluding shoulder as
she followed him around the room, flushed
with her eloquence—“please take this
money. If you knew how happy I’d been
all the time to think that I was working for
you, and how I had set my heart on it, you
wouldn’t be so unkind. I know I told you
my shoes were bad, but they do quite well as
they are, and the children do not need warm
underwear yet. It was very stupid of me to
talk of it, and it will make all the difference
how you are dressed when you go to see
Mr. Effingham. You’ve often said what a
difference a person’s appearance made—and
it’s so unlike you to look shabby! You
ought to do everything to try and get that
position; you can’t afford to lose the ghost
of a chance. You are so foolish, you won’t
listen to reason! Oh, Francis, won’t you
stand still and answer me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll answer you,” said Mr. Townsend
deliberately. “You can ‘reason,’ as you call
it, until you’re blind. Once for all, I will
never take that money.”</p>

<p>“You will.”</p>

<p>“I will not. Now, Polly not another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
word; do you hear? Not another
word!”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mrs. Townsend, as before
with conventional obedience, and followed
the words with a reckless flash of her grey
eyes as she left the room, murmuring with
quick breath: “But I give you fair warning,
I’ll make you take that money yet; I don’t
care whether you’re angry or not. You’ll
see, you’ll see!”</p>

<p>If the subject was dropped from speech
afterwards it was nevertheless present in
thought. Mr. Townsend rose late in the
morning, as is the habit of the man “out of
a position,” who has no place on the early
trains into town with his customary confrères,
the workers, or in their busy offices. The
heads of departments whom he goes in to
see are only accessible in the later hours, and
a delayed breakfast obviates the necessity for
luncheon. When husband and wife parted,
he in the trousers that were a good deal too
short and a good deal too worn, she, indeed,
broke through the ice with temerity to adjure
him for goodness sake not to let any one see
him to-day with those on, and he had retorted
grimly that he would endeavour to
keep his hundred and eighty pounds entirely
invisible to oblige her.</p>

<p>During the course of the morning Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Townsend went around with knitted brows,
pondering deeply over the vexed question.
Her back ached and her feet were weary
long before her household labours were
ended. She wasn’t accustomed to doing her
own work, and, though she was willing, experience,
that time-saver, was not hers. Mrs.
Townsend knew that ladies were popularly
supposed to bring a deftness and daintiness
to kitchen work that was lacking in the efforts
of a rougher class, but for herself it was just
the opposite. The scalding kettles and
saucepans she carried would perform a
tremolo movement with the shaking of her
slight wrists that sent greasy splashes of the
contents over the kitchen floor; the beef-steak
she broiled took in not only the fire
but the whole top of the range in its sputterings,
and plates and dishes, whether empty
or filled with food for the table, slipped from
her tired fingers and broke with ruinous
celerity. After all the ceaseless effort of her
heroic incapacity she was forced to long for
the look of shining cleanliness accomplished
easily by the strong, accustomed arms of an
ordinary “girl.”</p>

<p>And the children were going half-clothed,
she had so little time to sew! If this sort of
thing didn’t stop soon she didn’t know what
would become of them all. Depression had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
grown to be her usual frame of mind in the
morning when there was no one to look at
her. She had known that Francis couldn’t
get a place when he was so shabby. People
were afraid of men who looked poor; it
seemed as if they couldn’t be capable. In
spite of himself she must save him, though he
hurled javelins at her afterwards. She would
have gone and bought him the trousers out
of hand if remembrance had not brought uncomfortably
to mind a time when she had
tried to demonstrate how economically she
could regulate his smoking by purchasing an
advertized box of cigars from a department
store. To Polly Townsend, if you did a
certain thing one certain effect ought to follow—that,
instead, it ramified off into all
sorts of different ways was the mean advantage
life took over theory. She felt now that
if she could only make her Francis buy those
trousers he couldn’t help realizing gratefully
afterwards how wise and good she’d been,
and her heart glowed at the prospect.</p>

<p>But Mr. Effingham! He was a man whose
old-fashioned punctiliousness was notably
affected by externals: by suitable dress, by
polish of manner, by a certain air in addition
to more solid requirements. It was bad
enough for Francis to hand the plate in
those hideous, old, faded, mended trousers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
but to go supplicantly in them to Mr. Effingham
would be suicidal. She could have
wept at the thought.</p>

<p>Yet later in the day Mrs. Townsend might
have been seen with a face lightened by a
persistent smile—a jimpy, sly, inwardly-lurking,
swiftly-flashing, three-cornered gleam
that took in two reckless eyes and a demure
mouth, and brought forth curious comment
from Mrs. Whymer, a friend whom she met
in the street.</p>

<p>“How well you do look! No one would
think you had a girl of ten—but you always
did have colour. I feel all dragged out; the
doctor says I’m just going on my nerves.
My husband has been home all day. No,
there’s nothing really the matter with him,
just one of his attacks, but he always gets so
worried about himself. I often tell him,
when he sits there looking so depressed, if
he only knew all I go through without saying
a word! Having a man around the
house is so upsetting, but I suppose you’re
used to it. Mr. Townsend hasn’t anything
yet, I believe?”</p>

<p>“He has several positions in view,” said
Mrs. Townsend with elegant indefiniteness,
and a quick, hot resentment at the implied
reproach, which was answerable for the expenditure
of twenty-five cents of her little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
hoard for peaches to be used in the manufacture
of the deep peach pie which her
Francis loved.</p>

<p>She derived an exquisite satisfaction from
outwitting him in this way, forcing her money
thus secretly down his throat, watching him
eat each mouthful, and meeting his raised
eyebrows and the “Isn’t this a little extravagant?”
with the reassuring answer:</p>

<p>“Now, it’s all right; I just want you to
enjoy it. No, Frankie, no more; you had a
large plateful.”</p>

<p>“You made papa be helped three times,”
said Frankie.</p>

<p>Her husband put an affectionate arm
around her when she came up-stairs afterwards.
“Fixed those trousers for me to-day,
dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I fixed them,” said Mrs. Townsend.</p>

<p>“That’s a good girl. These I have on
now—I don’t believe they’d last over another
day.”</p>

<p>“You see Mr. Effingham to-morrow, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I believe I do,” said Mr. Townsend
with an effect of carelessness. Heaven
only knew how their two thoughts travelled
together in that long hopefulness that must
have an end somewhere in something tangible.
Yet even as they sat there Mr. Townsend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
became conscious of a not unknown
quantity.</p>

<p>“What do you want to keep kissing my
hand for? What have you been doing? You
haven’t lamed your back again moving the
flour-barrel, I hope. See here,” his tone suddenly
stiffened, “you haven’t been spending
that money of yours for——”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Townsend hurriedly. “Not
a penny; well, just a few cents for peaches.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew you bought them,” said Mr.
Townsend indulgently. “Well, that pie was
awfully good, but don’t do so any more. I
don’t like it, Polly; it hurts.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mrs. Townsend in an
odd voice. She faced him with gleaming
eyes. “I’ll never do anything that doesn’t
please you, no matter how foolish it is. If
you say the sky is pea-green I’ll say it is
pea-green, too. And if you want to kill
yourself I’ll bring the carbolic acid. Oh, yes,
I’m to be just too sweet for anything and
never say boo when you want to go out
looking like a tramp and ruin every chance
you have just because it ‘hurts you’ to take
this money from me, from your own wife.
Haven’t I a right to earn money for you, and
love and help you, and work my fingers off
for you, if I want to?” Her voice trembled.
“Wouldn’t I rather go barefoot than see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
way you’ve looked this last month?” She
refused to quail before his gaze as she went
on piteously: “Oh, you’re so exactly like a
man. I know you just hate to hear me talk
like this. I know I’ll never convince you in
this wide world, but some things hurt <em>me</em>!
Francis——”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Townsend as she stopped
short. He had withdrawn his arm from
around her.</p>

<p>“I want you to take that money.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go down and read for a while
if you don’t mind,” said Mr. Townsend dryly.</p>

<p>Francis Townsend was always a punctilious
man as to his toilette, but the next morning
he made it a sort of continuous performance.
Mrs. Townsend down-stairs, “redding up” the
place after the children, and keeping his
breakfast hot, felt her heart thump and sink
alternately as she heard his footstep advance
and retreat interminably on the floor above.
Her coat and hat lay upon a chair, in furtherance
of her morning journey to market, but
no matter what she was doing her eyes
turned, in spite of herself, to the place set for
Francis at the end of the table, where there
was a fringed napkin, a plate, a knife and
fork, and a coffee-cup with the unusual addition
of a little roll of greenbacks sticking up
in it. Prepared as she was for some commotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
she involuntarily clutched a chair back
as she caught the sound of a quick and
angry stride across the room above to the
hall, and heard the tone of towering wrath:</p>

<p>“Polly!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Francis.”</p>

<p>“Did you cut off the leg of this pair of
trousers?”</p>

<p>“Your breakfast’s in the oven,” said Mrs.
Townsend glibly, “and the coffee’s on the
stove. I’ve got to go to market.” She flung
herself into her jacket and hat as she spoke,
jabbing in the hatpins viciously. The triumph
was exciting, but she didn’t know she was
going to be quite so scared. She hesitated
a moment, and then called back: “Good-bye,
dearest!” as she closed the hall door and
then ran down the steps into the street.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Seventy-five cents for each dancing lesson,
but if there are two in the family she
makes a reduction.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Whymer sat rocking idly while she
watched Mrs. Townsend basting seams on a
dark piece of cloth, in her little sewing-room.</p>

<p>“I’ll see about it to-morrow when I’m in
town,” said Mrs. Townsend.</p>

<p>“Going shopping? If you want that skirt
pattern I’ll get it for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, I would like it,” said Mrs.
Townsend, “though I’m not going shopping
exactly; I have to take Pinky to the dentist’s—it’s
so long since she’s been—but I may
get some material for myself on the way
home.”</p>

<p>Her husband had been for several months
with Mr. Effingham, and they were just about
beginning to get their feet on the first rungs
of the ladder which leads to the plateau of
Living Like Other People.</p>

<p>“Why on earth did you cut up those trousers
to make knickerbockers for Frankie?”
said the other, taking up the end of Mrs.
Townsend’s work. “They look just like
new, and the cloth doesn’t seem worn at all.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t,” said Mrs. Townsend briefly;
“Mr. Townsend only had them on a few
times. They are the best material, they were
bought at Brooker’s, and I thought he’d get
such good wear out of them, but he says
there’s something wrong with the cut.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s no use to try and make a man
wear anything he doesn’t want to,” said Mrs.
Whymer. She yawned as she rose. “You
don’t say I’ve been here over an hour! I do
get so lonesome at home all day, and Mr.
Whymer is working until eleven o’clock every
night. I’m thinking of going to that new
sanitarium at Westly for a while. I really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
haven’t been able to do a thing for the last
six weeks. I get so tired out ordering the
meals, and the doctor thinks I had better try
a rest cure. Your husband likes it with
Mr. Effingham, I hear. He was very fortunate
in getting the position. Mr. Butts tried
for it, but he always looked so—well, not
up-to-date, you know. Clothes do make
such a difference.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I always say,” returned Mrs.
Townsend demurely, with a queer little hazy,
retrospective smile, that was somehow wistful,
too. Her wisdom had certainly been
vindicated, yet there were results that, as
usual, eluded theory. She was never quite
sure whether her rebellion had been a success
or not. The time might come when she and
her Francis would laugh over it together in
company—but it hadn’t come yet.</p>

<h3>The Mother of Emily</h3>

<p>“If I had only the foundation, but I
haven’t that, or the trimming, either;
nothing but this old, tumbled <em>chiffon</em>
and these faded flowers.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Briarley looked dejectedly at the mass
of frippery in her lap. Five dollars for a new
hat such as she wanted would leave only one
dollar from her own private purse for the
Easter collection, and the sermon last Sunday
had been a plea for religious enthusiasm
in giving at this season.</p>

<p>Mrs. Briarley was a fair, pretty little thing,
although slight almost to meagreness in her
immaturity of outline. She was foolishly
young to be the wife of a man of thirty and
the mother of a two-year-old child.</p>

<p>In spite of this she had an earnest soul, and
pondered deeply over each perplexing question
of her married life as it arose. The mere
fact of having to decide anything enveloped
her in a sort of confusion which obscured
every guide-post which experience had
erected, the more so that, as her husband
travelled, she could not have recourse to him.
It was as if each occasion had been evolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
whole from space to have its merits decided
upon, whether it were a question of little
Emily’s going out to play in the damp, or the
quantity of material for a new skirt, or which
kind of breakfast food to order.</p>

<p>Just now it was the question of the hat.
There was indeed no question as to whether
she needed it or not, but her husband’s means
kept her within certain limits.</p>

<p>To make a whole hat would cost very nearly
five dollars; if other people did it for less, she
wasn’t able to. And Mr. Beatoun, the clergyman,
had said that he wanted to make an
appeal to each one personally. Each one
must judge for himself if he were doing all he
could to pay off that debt on the church for
which he urged the special effort now.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Briarley the question seemed to
have relation to those deep places of decision
which govern the current of one’s life. If she
refused this appeal she would not be quite
what the mother of Emily ought to be.</p>

<p>She was painfully anxious that Emily
should have every advantage. She herself
had been a neglected orphan, brought up in
helter-skelter fashion, and she longed above
all things that her baby should have the
maternal ideal she had lacked. She was
glad that Mr. Beatoun’s sermon had come
after she had bought little Emily’s hat, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
she felt secretly that no appeal could have
been strong enough to have denied that
sweet white ribbon and the daisies to her
child.</p>

<p>“If I had <em>any</em> trimming that could be
used!” she murmured for the third time, and
turned as the servant came into the room.
“What is it, Ellen?”</p>

<p>“There’s a lady down-stairs, ma’am—Mrs.
Stebbins.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. <em>Stebbins</em>!” Mrs. Briarley’s
tone was one of doubtful welcome.</p>

<p>This was one of the ladies of the parish in
which Mrs. Briarley was a newcomer, and in
which she still felt herself wistfully an outsider,
in spite of the fact that Mr. and Mrs.
Beatoun had formally called upon her, and
Mrs. Stebbins had conscientiously shaken
hands with her at the church door.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Stebbins had also once come to
collect, and to collect now, in addition to an
appeal, would be futile as far as Mrs. Briarley
was concerned.</p>

<p>She nerved herself to meet the words
that followed after the first greetings were
over.</p>

<p>“I want to know if you won’t give something
to our church sale.”</p>

<p>“The church sale? Oh, no, I—I don’t
think I care to be connected with anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of the kind—at least—I mean, this year,”
said Mrs. Briarley, hurriedly.</p>

<p>The last time she had taken part in a fair,
before moving to this place, her sympathy
had run unwarrantably ahead of her purse.
She had indulged in that specious form of
charity which consists of buying goods on
credit and then presenting them to the
church. She had a vivid remembrance of a
box of soap which another woman had bought
for half price at the fair, “because it was
given, and whatever was made on it was
clear gain.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Briarley had had to pay the full price
at the grocer’s a month later, when the bill
was already too large. Her husband had not
liked it, and she felt wary of fairs.</p>

<p>“A fair! Oh, no, indeed, this isn’t a fair!”
Mrs. Stebbins, a sallow, greyish, compactly
solid lady in a short walking-skirt and a
small, tight hat, smiled intelligently at her
hostess. “It’s a sale—a rummage sale. I’m
surprised that you haven’t heard of it; it’s
been in progress two weeks already. Of
course, though, you don’t belong to the Guild.
There are only three days more for the sale,
and we <em>do</em> want them to be a success. The
proceeds go to the church debt. A rummage
sale—you know what that is. You send any
old things you have—<em>any</em>thing; it doesn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
make any difference what it is, and we sell
them to the poor for a few cents. We hired
an empty store at the other end of the town—64
Herkimer Street. Some of our ladies
take charge of it in turn.”</p>

<p>“And do you sell much?” asked Mrs.
Briarley.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stebbins laughed. “Do we sell
much? We have made fifteen hundred dollars
already. You know it’s really an accommodation
to the poor—many of them will
buy things when they wouldn’t beg for them.
They get good warm clothing and stores for
a song. And quite a number of us pick up
odds and ends there—really! You don’t
know what fascinating things we take in now
and then; nobody knows where half of them
come from. Some of them are quite new.
There was a lovely jacket sent in last week;
Mr. Stebbins’s sister said she would have
bought it herself—she doesn’t live here—if
the sleeves had been a little longer. And
there was a white satin lambrequin, embroidered
in gold thread,—one end had oil spilled
over it,—and Minnie Ware bought it for a
quarter, and she’s made the most fetching
collar and vest front that you ever saw. Of
course, Minnie Ware can do <em>anything</em>—she
doesn’t care a snap who knows. Have you
met Miss Ware? She belongs to the Guild.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Briarley, with the pang of
the outsider.</p>

<p>“Well, I bought a colonial chair myself
there yesterday; there’s a rung gone, but it
can easily be put in. You <em>will</em> send something,
won’t you? Some of our ladies are in
charge from nine until six.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ll try to,” said Mrs. Briarley, hesitatingly.
“We got rid of most of our rubbish
when we moved here. Is Mrs. Beatoun
at the sale?”</p>

<p>She had a reverential admiration for the
rector’s wife, as a person who in that position
must be superhumanly good. She longed to
know her as other people did. She had been
sensitively quick to feel the alteration from
the conventional politeness of Mrs. Beatoun’s
manner to her to the intimate interchange of
laughing remarks with a party of friends
afterwards. Mrs. Briarley had indeed been
asked to join the Guild, but she could not get
up her courage to face so many strangers
alone.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Beatoun will not be at the sale
to-day,” said Mrs. Stebbins, rising to go.
“I’ve just come from the rectory now. She
had such a pleasant surprise—the present of
a lovely hat from her cousin. She had to go
into mourning for her mother-in-law, and so
she sent this hat to Mrs. Beatoun, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
made in Paris, and I don’t believe it was ever
worn more than twice. It’s a perfect beauty!”</p>

<p>“That must have been very nice,” said
Mrs. Briarley, with the thought of the hat for
which she longed.</p>

<p>“Well, I should think so! To get a hat
like that without paying a cent! And if ever
anybody needed one it was Mrs. Beatoun.
She’s worn that old black straw for five years;
but after all, you’d hardly know it. She’s
got that sort of an air about her—almost too
much for a clergyman’s wife, some people
think—that makes you feel as if she <em>was</em>
dressed up when she isn’t. Is this your little
girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Briarley, with the tremulous
flush that always came into her cheek
when little, dark-curled, lustrous-eyed Emily
suddenly appeared in her dainty white frock
and little slippers. She looked at her visitor
with an expression which said, “Did you ever
see anything as beautiful as this?”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Stebbins only remarked, “She
favours her papa, doesn’t she? I don’t see
much resemblance to you,” patted the child’s
head, shook hands with Mrs. Briarley, and
was gone, with a parting injunction not to
forget the rummage sale.</p>

<p>Mrs. Briarley knelt down on the floor by
Emily that she might gather the plump little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
standing form more fully into her thin young
arms. She loved and respected her husband
greatly, but her humble soul magnified the
Lord daily for this wonder and joy of being
the mother of Emily. She had a way of
pressing the little soft cheek to hers, as now,
and saying, “Baby <em>dear</em>,” in a tone of ineffable
love, that at once embodied her bliss and
a prayer that she might be worthy of it.
When she left the child now she knew that
there was only one path to choose. She must
go without her hat. She <em>must</em> respond to the
appeal.</p>

<p>She thought of it all the time she was selecting
her slender dole of rubbish for the sale—a
vase that had been mended and a couple
of books. As she was walking to Herkimer
Street she imagined herself in a ninety-eight-cent,
ready-trimmed straw turban. One
could hardly realize how earnestly solemn
the sacrifice was to her.</p>

<p>Dress was a very serious matter. She had
a natural daintiness, a touch that was almost
genius. It was a feminine charm which even
her husband recognized, and she liked to see
him like to look at her. Perhaps he would
not now. If she could only have a hat given
her, like fortunate Mrs. Beatoun!</p>

<p>The window of the temporary shop was
filled with a heterogeneous mass of clothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
before which stood a group of hatless women
and a few children. Mrs. Briarley nervously
pushed her way past them, for she was always
afraid of contagion on account of Emily.
She became still more nervous on her entrance
into the shop.</p>

<p>It was filled with a swarm of Italian women,
bright-shawled, earringed, swarthy and voluble,
fingering the piles of cast-off clothing and
chaffering over them. The air was bad, and
the two young girls behind the counter looked
singularly helpless and distracted. One was
sitting down with her head upon her hand,
but the other responded to Mrs. Briarley’s
proffer of her gifts.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—thank you! <em>Would</em> you please
put the price on them yourself? Here are
tags and a pencil. Mark them <em>anything</em>. I
can’t leave this corner for a minute. I never
was in such a place! I really don’t know
what to do. The young lady who <em>was</em> waiting
here—Miss Morley—<em>fainted</em> a few minutes
ago,—it’s the air, you know, and the
window won’t open,—and Mrs. Whitaker has
just taken her home. They say she’s the
<em>second</em> one that’s fainted to-day.”</p>

<p>“How dreadful!” said Mrs. Briarley, with
admiring pity. These were indeed martyrs
to the cause.</p>

<p>“<em>Isn’t</em> it? Mrs. Whitaker just asked me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
come in and stay with Gladys till she got
back, and now Gladys has such a headache
she isn’t the slightest good, and it all comes
on me. I’m only visiting here, and I’ve got
to take the three o’clock train home. It puts
me in an awful position.”</p>

<p>She turned to a couple of wildly gesticulating
women.</p>

<p>“Yes, you can have that dress for ten cents.
No, <em>no</em>! Not you; the other one. No, you
<em>didn’t</em> speak first! I’ll send for the police if
you claw each other.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything I can do?” asked Mrs.
Briarley.</p>

<p>“If you wouldn’t mind unwrapping some
of those things over there, and marking them,”
said the girl. “I haven’t had time to see to
them since they came in. Mark them anything.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mrs. Briarley, going
deftly about the work. There was a waist
and some boys’ clothing, and there was a
box, which she left for the last. It looked as
if it might contain a hat.</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> a hat. A dark hat, yet not too dark,
elegant, yet not noticeable, with a chaste outline,
a temperate, subdued richness of effect
that spoke volumes to the initiated. No wonder
that Mrs. Briarley’s eyes were glued to it
as she held it in her hand. It was a hat that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
could rise to the occasion of state garments
or impart “style” to one’s ordinary garb. It
was a hat, in short, that could be Worn with
Anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. Briarley turned it round and inspected
it with a growing wonder. The white satin
lining looked new, and the structure itself
showed no sign of wear but two holes through
which a hatpin had been thrust.</p>

<p>There <em>were</em> people who gave away things
as little used as this. Mrs. Stebbins had
spoken of it. If she herself had ever possessed
a hat like this,—her thought went in
leaps,—if it were not a rummage hat! But
what if it were? Would any one know?
There were many hats made on the same
order. With a slight change in the front
trimming—of course you didn’t know who
had worn it before, but there was a subtle
odour of violet about it that was reassuring.</p>

<p>“How much is this hat?” asked Mrs.
Briarley, suddenly, in an odd voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said the girl who had
spoken before, looking around to catch a
glimpse of it. “I sold a hat for fifteen cents
just before you came in.”</p>

<p>“This is <em>very</em> good,” said Mrs. Briarley.</p>

<p>“Ask a quarter for it, then. For goodness’
sake, Gladys, don’t you get faint!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll take it myself,” said Mrs. Briarley,
hastily. “My—my cook might like it.” She
put it back in the box and tied the string
around it. “The atmosphere in here <em>is</em> dreadful,
isn’t it? Can’t I help you open that
window? Here’s the money. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>She had done it! She could hardly believe
in the miracle. Not only would she
have the happy thrill of responding to the
appeal with her own precious and individual
five dollars, but the very price she had paid
for the hat went to the cause also, and she
had money left over besides! And she had
the hat!</p>

<p>She felt awestricken at so much reward of
virtue. It was like seek ye first the kingdom
of righteousness and all these things shall be
added unto you. If she had said her cook
might like the hat, that was no lie; her cook
well might. And she was so glad that she had
enough humility herself to wear a rummage
hat! Underneath all the simplicity of her vanity
lay an earnest and tremulous joy in being
more what the mother of Emily should be.</p>

<p>It has been stated that Mrs. Briarley did
not belong to the Guild. She passed a delegation
from it, indeed, the next day, all busily
talking together; but there was nobody in it
whom she even knew to bow to. She was
perhaps the only woman in the parish who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
did not know of the exciting incident at present
disturbing it, the facts of which were
being now recounted once again.</p>

<p>“Yes, the hat was almost new; it was a
present to Mrs. Beatoun from her cousin. It
was a beauty. Mrs. Beatoun was going out
to lunch, and she sent the Peters boy back to
the parsonage to get some bundles for the
rummage sale, and that stupid new girl of
hers gave him the box with the hat in it with
the other things from her room. She had left
it on the bed. So off it went to the sale.
The only one who remembers anything about
it is Gladys Tucker, and she doesn’t remember
much, she had such a headache. She
says a lady—she thinks it was a lady—came
in and bought one for a quarter; she heard
her talking to Nannie Leduc. Gladys didn’t
even see it; the place was full of Italians.
Of course the woman took advantage.”</p>

<p>“Those girls are so scatter-brained! But
no lady would have bought a hat there.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I say. If she did, she
must have known it was a mistake. That
hat cost thirty dollars, and it had been worn
twice. And to pay only a quarter for it! It
was as bad as <em>stealing</em>. You know how reserved
Mrs. Beatoun is, but she’s decided,
very. Well, she did say that if she saw any
woman with it on she thought she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
really walk up to her and speak about it.
It’s the effrontery of the thing that’s so maddening.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beatoun never seemed to care much
for clothes,” said one lady.</p>

<p>“I suppose she’s human, like the rest of
us,” said the first, grimly. “She’s worn that
black straw of hers five summers.”</p>

<p>“I do believe she’d rather go without than
not have just the right thing,” said yet
another. “Her family always thought a
great deal of themselves, I’ve been told.”</p>

<p>“Well, they have a right to,” said the first
speaker again. “Mrs. Beatoun’s a good
woman, but I didn’t blame her for being angry
to-day. When she’s worked as hard as she
has for the church, to be cheated in this way!
And Gladys Tucker says she’s sure it was a
lady. Well, I told Mrs. Beatoun one thing.
I said, ‘Be sure we’ll all look out for
her!’”</p>

<p>Through all the week in which the disappearance
of Mrs. Beatoun’s Paris hat was
canvassed Mrs. Briarley remained happily
unconscious.</p>

<p>The excitement had reached fever-heat
on Easter Sunday, that Sunday on which
Mrs. Briarley’s precious five-dollar bill was
solemnly laid in the contribution plate. She,
all her little lone self, was actually paying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
off part of the church debt! It seemed to
her as she left the church that several women
looked at her rather oddly—or was it at her
hat? She had changed the trimming a little
in the front. Perhaps they were admiring
it.</p>

<p>She had expected to take little Emily to
the children’s service in the afternoon, and
when the child fell asleep instead, she went
by herself. The service was pretty; it was
full of flowers and music and children’s voices.
When it was ended she stood in the vestibule,
lingering, with her eyes fixed on a group of
women talking to Mrs. Beatoun.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Beatoun detached herself
from the group and came forward, with tall
figure held erect. There was a breathless
pause. Those who were there knew that the
wearer of the hat and the owner of the hat
had met at last.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mrs. Briarley, “I’m so glad you
came to speak to me! I’ve been just hoping
that you would!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Mrs. Beatoun.</p>

<p>“I wanted to tell you—I’ve never enjoyed
going to church as I have to-day.” Mrs.
Briarley raised her rapt eyes to those of the
rector’s wife, who wore a little half-cynical
smile. “I think your husband preaches such
beautiful sermons. I never heard any that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
made me feel so much like—like wanting to
be good.” Her voice dropped shyly.</p>

<p>“That is very nice, I’m sure,” said Mrs.
Beatoun, politely. “May I ask where you
got your hat?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you asked!” said Mrs.
Briarley. She was so full of her own earnestness
of purpose that she kept on, oblivious to
the chill in Mrs. Beatoun’s tone. Her cheeks
became pink, her eyes suffused. “I bought
it at the rummage sale. Of course it must
have been worn before, although it doesn’t
look it. I bought it because—I’ve been
wanting to tell you that after Mr. Beatoun’s
appeal I <em>couldn’t</em> spend the five dollars I had
meant to on a hat, although I needed one. I
just bought this at the sale, and gave the
money to the church. I thought Mr. Beatoun
might like to know he had made somebody
feel that way. I never have thought of—things—before,
and I wanted to thank him.
I have been saying to myself, as I stood
here, that if you came forward to speak to
me, I’d take it as a—sign that I was to tell
you this.”</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and then went on.
(While you were unburdening your heart, why
not tell all?)</p>

<p>“I have a dear little girl at home, and I do
so want to learn to be better—for her sake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
And I’ve thought if I could know you—I’ve
been sort of afraid of you before, but I’m not
now. And I love my little girl so <em>very</em>
much——” She stopped again.</p>

<p>Something passed from one to the other
as they stood there—Mrs. Briarley did not
know what. There was a wonderful and
sweet gentleness in the face of the older
woman as it bent to the simple earnestness
of the other. Mrs. Briarley’s one little thought
of truth had unerringly met and rounded its
circle. It is not only at the sacramental table
that we are partakers together of the Bread
of Life.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you told me!” said Mrs.
Beatoun. She was not a demonstrative
woman, but in that pause she had put her
arms round Mrs. Briarley and kissed her,
under the very shade of the rummage hat.</p>

<p>“And Mr. Beatoun will be glad, too. No,
indeed, you must never be afraid of me again;
and you must bring your little girl to see us.
It was just sweet of you to think of telling
me about the hat.”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed people looking at it,” said
Mrs. Briarley, all in a glow. “I never
thought until to-day that it might be a mistake
about its being sent to the sale. But
you don’t think so?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not a mistake,” said Mrs. Beatoun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
with a sudden smile, as she added “and I’m
in a position to know.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Yes, I’ve joined the Guild,” said Mrs.
Briarley, with pride in her tone. “They’ve
made me secretary already.” She did not
know how cordially that position was made
the portion of the stranger. She was talking
to her husband the evening of his return.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Beatoun couldn’t have been more
interested about that five dollars if she had
given it herself. You’ve no idea how nice
everybody in the Guild is to me; they seem to
take pains to be kind. But Mrs. Beatoun—there’s
something about Mrs. Beatoun I can’t
explain!”</p>

<p>“Well?” said her husband, enjoyingly.
Mrs. Briarley was in a washed white muslin,
with ribbons the exact blue of her innocent
eyes. She did not look as if she could be the
mother of an Emily.</p>

<p>“I believe Mrs. Beatoun is really—fond of
me!”</p>

<p>“That’s very strange,” said Mrs. Briarley’s
husband.</p>

<h3>Madonna of the Toys: A Christmas Story</h3>

<p>“I don’t know what to give him for
Christmas!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tom looked tragically at the
group consulting over their father-in-law in
the old-fashioned library. Miss Clara, the
unmarried daughter, had left the room.</p>

<p>“We have a picture,” announced Mrs.
Andrew complacently; “a cathedral interior,
beautifully dark and perspective. Little Mary
has a cup and saucer, and Francis a whisk
broom.”</p>

<p>“My boys can give black-bordered silk
handkerchiefs,” said Mrs. Frank. “Clara
suggests that I have that armchair re-covered,
the one he never sits in.”</p>

<p>“Malcolm had better get him another
dozen cases of mineral water,” said Mrs.
Malcolm. “When it’s in the house he drinks
it. But that hardly seems enough, father’s
so generous to us. I shall buy a small refrigerator
for his room—it’s so useful in
sickness.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of rubber water-bags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
in assorted sizes?” suggested Mrs. Walter
eagerly. “If he had a pain in two or three
places at once they’d be very handy.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Mrs. Frank lowered her voice.
“I dread coming here Christmas afternoon
and staying to supper; don’t you? <em>We</em> can
get along all right, and the little girls bring
their dolls, but boys are so restless—and
men, too! It was so different when Kate
and her children were living here, but last
year——! Clara doesn’t know how to make
the house attractive.”</p>

<p>“She worries so now that father has to
stay up-stairs,” agreed Mrs. Malcolm feelingly.
“The boys love their grandfather,
but there’s nothing for them to do. Why,
Violet, you’re not going?”</p>

<p>“I must,” answered a girl with reddish
hair and pretty, long-lashed eyes, who was
Mrs. Arthur. She had risen, and was throwing
a white boa around her neck. Her white
teeth flashed suddenly in a smile: “I never
was of so much importance before. Good-bye,
everybody!”</p>

<p>She ran down the hall, looking in at an
open doorway to call an audacious “Last
tag!” to a tall old man who sat there reading,
and receive his quick, amused response
before she went swiftly homeward.</p>

<p>Violet’s appointment with the baby was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
very important indeed. As she sat afterwards
in the darkened nursery, with the
infant’s little downy head against her warm
breast, her thoughts went back to grandfather.
Somehow his Christmas prospects
depressed her—the dark picture and the
mineral water, the re-covered chair, the refrigerator
and the rubber bags seemed so unlightsome;
there was nothing from which the
most willing mind could conjure festivity.
Even the perennial handkerchiefs and whisk
brooms and cups and saucers failed to cheer
her. It seemed dreadful to be so old that you
weren’t supposed to want anything anybody
else did, to have everything so tiresomely
suitable. Violet had an irreverent desire to
send her father-in-law a pink necktie or a
flippant poster.</p>

<p>There could be no greater contrast to the
needs of Age than this softly-curtained place,
with its white furniture, and a blue rug in
front of the brass andirons on which the pine
logs burned aromatically. A blue and white
bassinet swung by a gilded rod, and a white
willow hamper showed the blue satin-lined
tray, filled with miniature ivory toilet articles,
and tiny garments, laced and ribboned—all
the dainty appanage of a “first” baby.</p>

<p>A silver and mother-of-pearl rattle and a
French clown, belled and tinselled, on a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
stick, lay upon the blue table-cover, while a
large drum, fastened on the wall above,
showed that in the pride of welcoming a boy
love hadn’t been able to wait for him to grow
into his heritage.</p>

<p>Her sisters-in-law characterized Violet fondly
as a mere child; in truth she was a jolly little
girl, but underneath the jollity were the directness
and insight, and the shy, deep feeling
of a child, so hidden as to be almost unguessed.
Only her husband saw and reverenced
that unfathomed sweetness. But even
he did not know of those far-off journeys
which her spirit took in company with her
little new-born son, in the wonder of his soft,
warm mouth, his tiny feet, and unconscious,
clasping fingers.</p>

<p>The birth of her child had been to Violet
also the birth of Thought; she pondered on
the mysteries; for the first time she realized
the existence of that great chain whose links
are composed alternately of life and death,
with the coming and the going of generations.
In this infant life she saw the time
when her own days should be numbered, and
grew pale, yet unafraid, as she held him
closer, because the goodness of God was so
near.</p>

<p>He was such a very little baby that he was
not much of anything as yet to any one but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
his mother, though his father was indeed unmeasurably
proud of him as a son and heir,
and regarded him with deeply expectant, if
amused, affection. But to Violet he was a
wellspring not only of the traditional pleasure
but of infinitely more. As one who stands
with the ear to a sea-shell, rapt with the
sound of the mysterious murmurs of the far-off
ocean, so Violet, when she sat bending
over her baby, felt a deep, tremulous connection
with beautiful, unseen things that were
holiness unto the Lord. She was so happy
that she longed for every one to be happy;
her child-heart even yearned maternally over
grandfather, who had lived so many years
that people couldn’t see that he was still
young. She was a partner in the secret; if
she called “Last tag” to him it was because
she knew he liked it. He was a kind, wise
old man, who submitted patiently to Miss
Clara’s fusses and restrictions because he saw
the love back of them; and he had lived his
life so fully and well that it did not seem
worth while to strive to live it now. Yet
sometimes, as Violet divined, he was contented
to dwell in the past because the present
was a little lonely now that the house was
no longer the rallying-place for the young, as
in the time of his daughter Kate, who had
children of her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Little blessedest! I want your grandfather
to have a Merry Christmas,” said
Violet confidingly to the baby in her arms,
who raised his tiny lashes as if in response,
and looked at her an instant before the lids
fell shut again. She pressed him closer in
adoration. “Oh, aren’t you sweet, <em>aren’t</em>
you sweet!” and fell to kissing him softly, a
process from which she found that mothers
gain wisdom.</p>

<p>“Did you decide what to get for father
yesterday?” asked her husband the next
morning. He was a man of noticeably fine
appearance, and a lawyer of repute; it was
still a wonder in the family how he had ever
come to marry Violet, who yet seemed to suit
him exactly.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Violet</p>

<p>“Then I think you’d better get that new
dictionary I was speaking of; it’s published
by Worden. I’ll leave you the money.”</p>

<p>“I thought he had so many dictionaries.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, that’s just the reason for
giving him another.”</p>

<p>“I will not get him a dictionary,” said
Violet. Yet she weakened after a tour
through the shops. She could find nothing
for her father-in-law that appealed in the
least to an imagination all ready to be fired.
Yet it was joy to be out for Christmas shopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in the crisp air to one who had been so
little able lately to go abroad, while before
her raptured vision she saw ever a wee sock
hung by the nursery hearth, and a tiny
lighted tree. Many little children were to be
made happy this holy-tide because her child
had come to her—Violet’s thank-offering had
flowed by many streams to reach unseen
baby hands. As she went along now she
stopped to slip coins into the palms of longing
boys and girls looking in at Christmas-decked
windows.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>Violet</em>!”</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Tom who clutched her. “Isn’t
it dreadful—the rush! I’m nearly dragged
to pieces. I’ve just bought an inkstand for
father, in the shape of a peach, with a thermometer
on it—the kind of thing no one ever
uses, but I was desperate. I’ve a big woolly
sheep for your baby, but if you think he’s too
little for it——”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>no</em>!” cried Violet, her face rosy with
pleasure. “How dear of you!” She could
have embraced Mrs. Tom before crossing
over to the toy store, a ravishing spot, one
window of which was given up to regiments
and regiments of lead soldiers afoot and on
horseback, on a green plain dotted with little
round white tents. The other window was
filled with dolls sitting at tea-tables, swinging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
or lying in pink or blue-and-white beds like
the baby’s at home. When Violet was a
little girl she had always been taken through
this shop at Christmas time; it was one of
the delights of the season, but never had it
seemed so delightful as now, when she was
buying toys for a “first” Christmas, while
music-boxes played, and animals squeaked,
and rattling, whirring mechanical toys ran
riot.</p>

<p>She stopped at last by a counter laden with
glittering tree ornaments. Opposite were
shelves filled with stationary engines varied
with an occasional boat or locomotive.
There seemed to be no clerk there, but a
small boy, seven or eight years of age, with
a white sailor cap pushed back to make a
halo around his short golden curls, was
walking backward and forward, regarding
the display with rapt, angelic eyes, and
incidentally putting out the tip of his chubby
forefinger to touch a cylinder or an electric
battery. Looking up suddenly he caught
Violet’s eye; they both smiled, and she came
over to him. So might her own little boy
look some day.</p>

<p>“Do you like engines?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the boy with a deep, indrawn
breath. He forestalled criticism: “I’m not
too little to have one; my papa says so!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
He’ll run it for me. He’s down-stairs now.”
He pointed to the shelf. “Do you see this
one? That’s where you pour the alcohol in—and
this is the steam gauge—and here’s
the safety-valve. She’s a hummer! And
this ’lectric—that’s a hummer, too!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Violet. She sought for more
definite accomplishment. “What do they
do?”</p>

<p>“They go!” answered the little boy.
“And they set other things going, too, if
you want ’em.” He indicated an array near
by: fountains, a man sawing wood, a printing
press, and the like. “You ’tach ’em by
a thread. See that one up there?” He
pointed to a large cylinder of grey burnished
steel. His tone fell to one of reverence.
“It pumps water!”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” exclaimed Violet with delightful
appreciation. “I’m so glad to talk
to you because I have a little boy myself,
but he isn’t as big as you—he’s only six
weeks old.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” said the little boy with his angelic
smile. “I never knew any one as little as
that.” He stopped disapprovingly. “Why,
that’s only a <em>baby</em>!”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s what people call him,” said
Violet, sagely; “they think he can’t even
talk. Of course he doesn’t really say anything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
but we have long conversations together—I
always know what he means.”</p>

<p>The little boy nodded. “My mamma and
I talk that way too,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“Then there’s another one—I wish you’d
tell me what to buy for him—he’s about
seventy or eighty years older.”</p>

<p>“But that’s an old man!” cried the boy in
wonder.</p>

<p>Violet shook her head. “Oh, no! Of
course, that’s what people call him,” she explained
again, tolerantly; “but we know
better.”</p>

<p>The boy looked at her debatingly. “Is
it ‘Once Upon a Time,’ or is it ‘A True
Story’?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s both,” said Violet.</p>

<p>Their eyes met this time in the joyousness
of mutual understanding.</p>

<p>“I like you, I like you,” cried the little
boy, and tucked his hand into hers, jumping
along with both feet in short flying leaps.
“Come here! I’ll show you what to buy for
him, I’ll show you; <em>that</em>! Oh, there’s my
papa beckoning to me!”</p>

<p>He dropped her hand and disappeared like
a flash in the crowd by the stairs.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Violet to herself, staring in
front of her. “Well—why not?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get here a minute sooner—I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
<em>had</em> to lie down after I got them all out of
the house.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tom, arriving late at the paternal
mansion on Christmas afternoon, was taking
off her wraps in the hall as she looked in at
the circle of sisters-in-law sitting around the
fire in the drawing-room, warm with the smell
of cedar, and bedecked with scarlet holly.
Through the open doorway beyond the mahogany
table, set with the old white-and-gold
china, showed promise of good things to
come.</p>

<p>“How cozy you all look in here—but where
are the others?” asked Mrs. Tom.</p>

<p>Miss Clara spread out her hands with a
gesture of dismay, belied by her beaming
face.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll never guess—every man and
boy is up-stairs with father, trying to run
that crazy engine Violet sent him; it’s one of
those dreadful electrical things. If I’d had
the remotest idea what was in the box—and
she never even told Arthur! You can’t get
one of them out of that room, except to—— Listen
to that!”</p>

<p>A boy’s footsteps came hurtling down the
back stairs, and a moment later an excited
voice called:</p>

<p>“Will it work?”</p>

<p>“No,” came from above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I see what’s the matter. Will it
work now?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment till I come up.”</p>

<p>“They’ve been doing that for two mortal
hours,” said Mrs. Malcolm placidly. “They
have miles of wire trying to attach something—don’t
ask me what, for I haven’t the
faintest idea. Of course it won’t work; engines
never do; if they did all the occupation
would be gone. My husband is just as
bad as the rest. They all have engines at
home, but they say Violet’s beats the lot.
Just hear that child laugh; she’s been up
there all the afternoon. We’ve been having
the most beautifully restful time down here
by ourselves. I haven’t seen father look so
happy in months, and in all that clatter! <em>Did</em>
you hear that Kate is coming back?”</p>

<p>“Will you listen to that!” said Mrs. Walter.</p>

<p>The inevitable footsteps were clattering
again madly down-stairs, with the accompanying
voice:</p>

<p>“Will it work?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I see what’s the matter with
it this time. Will it work now?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Wait till I come up!”</p>

<p>The end of a holiday is the dearest part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
a happy one, when the jewels are counted
over, to be strung on the silver thread of
memory. The lights were turned down low
in the nursery, so that the flames of the fire
of aromatic pine were reflected rosily from the
white surface of the enamelled furniture, as
Violet sat there in her loose blue gown, her
reddish hair half curling over her shoulders,
rocking her little son with his head pressed
against her white bosom. After all the merry
Christmas Day, after all the clatter, and jollity,
and family chatter, the supper, the plum pudding,
and the lighted candles, and the children’s
carols of the Child Divine, she was
back here once more with her little, little
son—the life that was mysteriously her life
too. Ah, not because of the feasting and
the presents, nor the merry companionship,
not all because of the inspiring engine even,
had the day been Christmas indeed to an
old man and those who felt the sweetness,
unknowing. Through Violet’s happiness had
come the Angel Note.</p>

<p>The drum hung upon the wall, and set out
on the blue rug was a small farmyard of
animals, with the large white woolly sheep
and a brown tin cow on wheels, towering
above them. On the table stood a tiny
Christmas tree, decked with a red, a blue
and a yellow candle, a little horse, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
horn, a candy hen and a glittering star, and
on the mantel was a paper angel in white
and tinsel with dovelike wings and floating
hair.</p>

<p>Violet’s husband coming through the room
put his hand tenderly on her hair as he passed.</p>

<p>“Little mother!” he said.</p>

<p>She leaned her head back against his hand,
her eyes mutely acknowledging his caress,
before she withdrew once more into that holy
place where she lived to-night with the child,
and where even the man she loved could not
follow her.</p>

<h3>The Name of The Firm</h3>

<p>“So you’ve lost your place,” said his
mother.</p>

<p>She looked with tender thoughtful
eyes at the lad before her, and smoothed his
fair hair with a hand that had to reach up to
touch it, for she was a little woman.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the boy, with a lip that he
could not keep from quivering a little.
“Somehow I didn’t expect it. Of course, I
know lots of the fellows have been turned off
lately; times are dull just now, and the firm
always cut down the force when they can.
It’s easy enough to take on new men when
they want them, and those who have been
there longest have first right to stay. I
know that. But somehow I had thought
that father’s work with them——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his mother. She sat down in
a low chair, and with a gesture drew the boy
to her side. “You say you had not expected
to be turned away, Francis. Neither had I
thought of it! There were reasons—— Your
father thought that your future was
assured, at least, if only—only as an atonement
to him. The firm did not promise me
to take care of you, to be sure, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
understood. They sent at once, you know,
and offered you the position. It was only
right that you should begin at the bottom of
the ladder.”</p>

<p>“The bottom of the ladder is about under
ground there,” said the boy with a whimsical
shake of his head. “It’s pretty low down, I
can tell you! Why there are firms not a
quarter so rich as they who pay their boys
more—enough for car-fare and shoes and
lunch, <em>anyway</em>—of course, though that’s one
of the ways they <em>get</em> rich. I’m not complaining.
But I thought to-day if father were the
head of the business, and I had been one of
Mr. Nelson’s boys——”</p>

<p>“Your father loved Mr. Nelson,” said the
mother, after a silence during which the two
had sat with clasped hands. “And Mr.
White too,” she added.</p>

<p>“And didn’t they love him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, once—before they began to make
so much money, and after it,—perhaps—sometimes!
I don’t know. Mr. Nelson was
moved when he came to see me that first
time; he meant to be kind about you. To
your father he was always the friend he had
loved even when he was cut to the heart
with John Nelson’s altered ways. There are
some people who are <em>born</em> constant.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you mind,” said the boy, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
wistfully, “that I am thrown out of the place?
I walked around the town two hours this
morning before I could make up my mind to
come and tell you, though I knew it Friday.
I was afraid it would be too great a shock to
you; and yet you don’t seem to think anything
of it at all.”</p>

<p>“You will be taken back with a larger
salary,” said his mother quietly. “You
need not look so startled, Francis. I know
Nelson and White—what they used to be,
and what they are now; I know them
thoroughly. If there were any other
way—— Dear, there are some things that
I cannot tell you, but your father’s son shall
not be turned from his old firm while I live.
They must respect the honour of their name.
No, don’t tell me not to go to them! I’ll
not shame you. I am not going to beg
them to take you back again, I have the
right to demand it. Trust me, Francis!”</p>

<p>“I do, mother,” said the boy, but half
doubtfully, as he stooped and kissed the face
raised to his.</p>

<p>It was a pretty face, with a broad low forehead
and clear grey eyes, dark now with a
purpose that he could not understand. He
felt uncomfortable without knowing why, as
he met their gaze. There was something in
them that was not like mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked a small enough figure going
down the street in her plain black garments
and little black bonnet—a small figure to
hold the fate of a big business house in that
white envelope in her hands. For two years
past she had felt that it would come to this
some day. The thrill of definite fulfilment
tingled now in every tense nerve. The father’s
fate should not be his son’s too.</p>

<p>She remembered her husband’s bright faith
in the friends of his youth, when they were
first married; how he had worked for them
with all the powers of body and mind, the
manager who ran the business machinery of
the house and whose honesty was like the
sun, radiating his every act, and whose justice
was tempered with mercy. Heaven only
knew—and heaven <em>did</em> know—how many
boys he had saved from temptation by the
kind word in season, how many men he had
heartened by his prompt recognition of work
well done. He was a man who gave of himself,
unvaryingly, to those with whom he
came in daily contact, and was a greater
factor in the prosperity of the great house
than the members of the firm. She remembered
how proud he had been of their commercial
honesty, and how he had kept his
faith in their own personal friendship for him
even after the benumbing influences of trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and the exigencies of prosperity had kept
them really aloof from each other for months
and years. When there was a child born, or
a death in the family, the business mask
dropped for a few minutes perhaps, to show
the old time faces underneath, and the
manager loved them, and talked about them
long afterwards to his wife. Some day, when
John Nelson and Harry White had time——</p>

<p>Then the policy of the house changed.
The manager’s salary was cut down; he was
no longer called into the confidences of the
firm. His wife remembered with hot cheeks
and clenched hands how that had hurt him.
It was the thought that they could have done
it; he would have lived on a pittance willingly
if they had needed money. But he defended
them, of course; it was his way. He was a
very proud man, so proud that his friends’
honour was as his very own; who doubted
it, insulted him.</p>

<p>And then—ah, that was hardest! to know
that what you love is rotten at the core.
That man had no business to tell her husband,
but every one in the house told George
more even of their own private affairs than
he cared to hear. Nothing that went on, for
or against their prospects, for or against the
good of the business, nay, for or against himself,
but was brought to his knowledge for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
comfort, advice, or denial. He had always
borne his full freight of other people’s
troubles.</p>

<p>But this thing—— His wife knew how
the burden of it had brought the beginning
of his illness. It struck at the life of the firm;
they had survived, but the blow had killed
him. They had used his honesty to cheat
with, and had offered him as the sacrifice
when they were on the point of detection.
Johnson, who partly in horror, partly in protesting
doubt, had shown him, with trembling
adjurations to utter secrecy, the incriminating
paper, did not know that George held the
other half of the clue. To have used it in his
own defense was to betray one who trusted
him, and defile the fair name of the firm.</p>

<p>His widow clasped the envelope tighter in
her hands. She had been to her husband the
priestess of his heart’s inmost confessional;
he had given her a sacred confidence.</p>

<p>But her whole soul rose in rebellion to the
thought that her boy was to be sacrificed as
her husband had been, with no hand upraised
to help him. Her hand was small, but it held
a mighty truth in it! All the sense of wrong,
and yearning heart-break of years, surged
within, to bring with them a fierce avenging
joy. Her promise to her husband? He had
not known to what it would bind her; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
felt herself fully absolved. Nelson and White,
Nelson and White, their day of reprisal had
come at last. The powerful fetich of their
name would crumble into dust, when she
struck it!</p>

<p>The dingy brick building with its gaping
doorway gave her a shock as she came suddenly
upon it. She had not seen it for over
two years. That was the doorway under
which George used to pass, the steep, worn,
wooden staircase, that up which he was wont
to climb daily. She had sometimes stopped
here for him on her way home. She held her
breath with a sickness of heart as she traversed
the familiar ways again, looking perforce in
at the windowed door behind which his desk
<em>used</em> to stand. She was to climb higher to-day,
to the sacred rooms of the Firm, the
mighty power that had brought into being
those rows and rows of clerks at the desks
below.</p>

<p>She took her seat on a wooden settle outside
the door of the office, which, open at the
top, was screened off with ground glass in
one corner of the long room, and waited her
turn for an audience. She hardly saw the
inquiring glances given her from time to time
by the clerks; she was full of an intensity of
purpose that cut through conventions like a
knife. But presently the conversation carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
on by the rising voices of men within the
office forced itself upon her consciousness
unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“Mein Gott! then I lose twenty t’ousand
dollar! Consider what that means to me,
shentlemen. At this time, at <em>this</em> time, it is
ruin!”</p>

<p>“You should have looked out for that
before, Hartmann,” answered a cold voice,
that the listener recognized as Nelson’s.
“We gave you opportunity to examine the
goods—you cannot say we did not. If your
man was a fool it’s not our fault. We gave
you opportunity.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oppo-<em>chu</em>nity,” moaned Hartmann.
“Mein Gott, what oppo-<em>chu</em>-nity! And the
whole cargo rotten! Consider, shentlemen,
that it is ruin.”</p>

<p>White’s high shrill tones broke in with an
imprecation, “Consider—as you’re so fond
of the word—that you tried to cheat us, and
got caught; consider that you tried to cut
<em>our</em> throat, and we’ve cut <em>yours</em>. You might
have known you hadn’t a ghost of a chance
with us. We <em>know</em> you’re ruined, and we
don’t <em>care</em>. Understand that. We don’t
care. Any one who thinks he can work
that game on us gets left. You’ve got the
rotten cargo, and we’ve got your twenty
thousand dollars, and we’re going to <em>keep</em> it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
If I were you I wouldn’t talk too much about
the story, you don’t show up any too well
in it.”</p>

<p>“But my wife, my shildrens,” moaned the
man.</p>

<p>“See here, Hartmann,” said Nelson, with
dignity, “this is business. Either you talk
business, or get out of here. On second
thoughts you get out of here anyway.
We’ve had enough of you for one day.
You think so, too, White? Shall I get somebody
to put you out, Hartmann? No? Then
<em>go</em>!”</p>

<p>He held the office door open, with a compelling
gesture of his free hand and a little
man, bowed together, weeping and mumbling
by turns, came stumbling out as if blinded.
As he did so, a boy with papers slipped into
the office, and behind him came a tall, pale
clerk, with shabby clothes, and a gentle, anxious
face.</p>

<p>“Ah, Cramer,” said Nelson, half looking
up from the papers as he scanned them
quickly in turn before affixing his signature.
“What can I do for you to-day?”</p>

<p>“I was told that you wanted to speak to
me, sir,” said Cramer.</p>

<p>“Mr. White, I believe, takes your department
in hand. White!”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” said White, “we shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
need you after the first of the month, Mr.
Cramer. You asked for an increase of
salary.”</p>

<p>“I cannot live on what I get now,” said
Cramer. “I have others to support.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. We are sorry, but you must
understand that we cannot run a charitable
institution. This is strictly business. On
inquiry, we find that other men in similar
positions are willing to live on <em>less</em> than you
are getting now, and it is our principle to
reduce our expenses whenever we can. You
must know that.”</p>

<p>The listener inferred that Cramer bowed.
“My services have been satisfactory, irrespective
of salary?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly. We shall be glad to recommend
you. That is all at present, Mr.
Cramer.”</p>

<p>He had gone. Mrs. Stannard sitting out
there felt a strange discomposure—pity, and
a helpless revolt against this iron system of
injustice: an injustice that hurt her idea of
the promoters of it more than those under
them—they had been her husband’s friends.</p>

<p>“There’s a lady waiting outside,” said the
boy, who was going out with the papers.
She rose perforce.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Stannard! Nelson, here is Mrs.
Stannard.” White handed out a chair from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
a dark corner, and Nelson came forward cordially.
Both men looked worn and tired,
Nelson tall and thin and dark, with deeply-lined
face; White, short and slight and fair.
Both gave an effect of trying to brush off an
habitual and haunting care, to welcome this
unexpected visitor. She had known them
since her girlhood; Nelson used to write
poetry, and White had even been in love
with her sister once. He was such a tender-hearted
fellow then, he couldn’t bear to have
the least of God’s creatures suffer pain. She
answered mechanically the usual inquiries as
to her health, while she was thinking of these
things.</p>

<p>“We are glad you happened to come in,
Mrs. Stannard,” said Nelson. “We have
just found that there was a little money due
your husband still on that last patent. Write
out a check for fifty-six dollars, if you please,
White, for Mrs. Stannard. There, that’s
right, I think. There is so much that’s disagreeable
in the business that we’re glad to
have something pleasant to communicate
occasionally.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Stannard. She added
after a moment, “Thank you.” She was
looking at the appurtenances of the little
office, and at the two men in it. This was
where George used to stand when he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
here to talk to them, in this dusty cramped
space, the high office desks half shutting out
the light. What had been his feelings? How
he had loved them, Nelson and White—Nelson
and White who had killed him!</p>

<p>Something hard in her eyes seemed to
strike White.</p>

<p>“We are sorry that we had to dismiss
Francis,” he said apologetically. “It is always
hard to have to make changes of that
kind, but we depend entirely on Mr. Ulmer’s
arrangements in that department. As I understand,
it was a choice between him and
Griggs, and Griggs had the better handwriting.
Francis should improve. It is simply
a matter of business.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Stannard again. She
sat there, a small, unpretending figure in her
black gown, very fair and young looking in
the dingy office surroundings. She was
twisting the white envelope in her fingers,
the weapon that George had unwittingly left
her that she was to wield in behalf of his son—if
she wanted to.</p>

<p>“We have missed George a great deal in
these last two years,” said Nelson with a
change of tone, and an obvious effort of
recollection. “Nobody had the interest in
the firm that he had, Mrs. Stannard. His
only fault was that he was not quite up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
date in matters of management; he was a
splendid organizer, but he let his feelings run
away with him too much. This recognizing
individual ability is all very well in its way,
but if you are going in to make money the
interests of the house must come first. George
never could drive a really sharp bargain—I
don’t mind saying it, Mrs. Stannard, for he
owned it himself—and it was a credit to his
heart, of course—he could not keep up to date
in that way. The modern methods of business
require <em>tremendous</em> concentration of purpose.
White and I”—he glanced at White,
who stood near him, gazing seriously at the
visitor—“have been quite worn out with our
efforts lately, but we have been very successful.
Of three firms who were in competition
with us at the beginning of the year, two
have broken up and had to give in to our
terms already, and the third will before long.
It’s a pretty fair record. George’s only fault—and
that was a credit to his heart—was
that he was not good at such transactions,
he let his feelings run away with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was his only fault,” said White.</p>

<p>Oh, if they only would not speak of George!
She suddenly felt that it was the one thing
she could not bear.</p>

<p>“How is your wife, Mr. Nelson?” she
asked hurriedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“My wife? She was well when I last heard
from her. She and the children have been
in Dresden—she is there for their education,
you know—expects to be gone three
years.”</p>

<p>“It must be very lonely for you. Why
don’t you go over, too?” she hazarded.</p>

<p>“Work, work! That’s what keeps me
here. I give you my word, Mrs. Stannard,
the business is so immense now, the operations
of the house so large, that I can hardly
take even a day off. Here’s White trying to
get away to his sick boy up in Minnesota for
a couple of weeks, and yet we can’t see how
to manage it, just at this time, without losing
the firm a deal that will give us enormous
profit.”</p>

<p>“Is your boy ill?” asked Mrs. Stannard,
turning sympathetically to White. His only
child was the age of her Francis.</p>

<p>White nodded, with his boyish face suddenly
turned grey and haggard, like that of
an old, old man.</p>

<p>“He—he’s crippled,” he answered. “He
had a bad fall. Didn’t you hear? Hurt
himself racing. The doctors give us some
hope, there’s no immediate danger, but his
strength seems to be going. That’s the main
point, you know—strength. I’ve thought if
I could get up to Minnesota just now, to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
his mother—— But I can’t seem to make
it out Of course, business comes first.”</p>

<p>“God <em>help</em> you, Harry!” said Mrs. Stannard,
softly. She had risen and he stretched
out his hand and took hers in it, and held it
for a moment in a tight grip, with his head
turned away.</p>

<p>“You were always good, Clara,” he said
huskily. “I hope He will.”</p>

<p>“You have dropped your letter,” said Nelson,
coming forward. “Or perhaps you do
not want it?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mrs. Stannard. “No,
I do not want it now.” Send Francis here,
where if he would be successful he must
learn to fight against every impulse of his
higher nature? What would his father have
said? She tore the paper into small pieces
with fingers that were firmly tense. “May I
put these in your scrap basket? I know
that I have taken up too much of your time,
Mr. Nelson, I will say good-bye.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to have seen you, Mrs. Stannard,”
he said. He looked at his partner,
who stood, turned from them, his arms resting
on the tall desk, and his head buried in
them, and then looked back again at her.
She made a movement of comprehension,
and slipped quietly out of the door, and
pulling her veil quickly over her face, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
down the long stairs again that her husband
had been wont to traverse, feeling that the
dear form was somehow at her side. But
she saw nothing, for her eyes were blinded
by tears, not for White’s sorrow, not for her
husband’s death, but for another and irremediable
loss; tears that overflowed and ran
down her cheeks, and seemed to keep welling
up exhaustlessly from her heart; tears
from a pity so deep that it had its source in
every happiness of high thought and noble
aim and unselfish love that had made her
life.</p>

<p>No need to break her faith with the dead!
She would not have her boy back in that
house of corruption, for all the gifts of Fortune.
No need, no need, for her to strike at
the name of the firm! That name, so loved,
so honoured, slaved for, died for—God in
heaven, for <em>what</em> did the Name of the Firm
stand?</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
